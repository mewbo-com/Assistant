# Architecture Overview

This page is the canonical internals document for Mewbo. It is written for developers embedding the core as a library, contributing new tools or channel adapters, or debugging session behaviour. Every other page in the documentation describes *what* a feature does; this page describes *how* each feature is implemented, which modules own the behaviour, and which data structures survive compaction or restart.

If you are setting up the product, start at [Get Started](getting-started.md). If you are looking up a capability, browse the [Capabilities](features-builtin-tools.md) section. The Feature pages link back here for the implementation detail they intentionally omit.

---

## Execution model

Mewbo uses a single async execution engine for every agent at every depth: `ToolUseLoop`. There is no separate planner, executor, or synthesiser. The LLM drives tool selection via native `bind_tools`. The orchestration layer steps the message array forward.

The loop runs until the LLM emits a text response with no tool calls. Budget warnings are injected as `SystemMessage` entries as the session approaches limits. The loop is never force-killed.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Orchestrator
    participant ToolUseLoop
    participant LLM
    participant Tools

    Client->>Orchestrator: user query
    Orchestrator->>ToolUseLoop: run(messages, tools)
    loop until LLM emits text only
        ToolUseLoop->>LLM: messages + bound tools
        LLM-->>ToolUseLoop: tool_calls[]
        ToolUseLoop->>Tools: execute (parallel-safe batched)
        Tools-->>ToolUseLoop: results
        ToolUseLoop->>ToolUseLoop: append results to messages
    end
    LLM-->>ToolUseLoop: final text response
    ToolUseLoop-->>Orchestrator: AgentResult
    Orchestrator-->>Client: response
```

**Tool concurrency.** Tools are partitioned into concurrent-safe batches and exclusive calls. Concurrent-safe tools execute in parallel with `asyncio.gather`. Exclusive tools run alone. Each tool has a configurable timeout (default 120 s). A timeout does not cancel sibling calls.

### Core components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `Orchestrator` | Session lifecycle, context building, and mode resolution. |
| `ToolUseLoop` | Async tool-use conversation loop. The single execution engine at every depth. |
| `AgentContext` | Immutable per-agent state propagated through the hierarchy. |
| `AgentHypervisor` | Control plane: admission control, lifecycle tracking, cancellation, cleanup. |
| `SpawnAgentTool` | Sub-agent creation with tool scoping (allowlist/denylist filtered before binding). |
| `Planner` | Plan generation via LLM (plan mode only). |
| `SessionRuntime` | Shared facade used by both CLI and API. |
| `SessionStore` | Transcript and summary storage. |
| `ToolRegistry` | Local tools plus external MCP tools, with `filter_specs()` for allow/deny. |

### Execution flow

Input arrives from a client (CLI, API, or a chat-platform adapter). The orchestrator builds a context snapshot (summary, recent events, selected history). In act mode, a single async `ToolUseLoop` executes. In plan mode, the `Planner` generates a plan without execution. The LLM can spawn sub-agents via `spawn_agent` for parallel sub-tasks, managed by the `AgentHypervisor`. Results are written to the session transcript.

---

## Instruction loading {#instruction-loading}

`discover_all_instructions()` performs an **upward pass** from the current working directory to the git root (or filesystem root) and loads instruction files in priority order (higher priority wins):

| Priority | Path | Scope |
|----------|------|-------|
| 10 | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User-global, all projects |
| 20–29 | `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/CLAUDE.md` walking up from CWD | Project hierarchy; CWD = 20, parent = 21, … |
| 30 | `.claude/rules/*.md` (all files, sorted) | Project-local rule set |
| 40 | `CLAUDE.local.md` | Machine-local override (gitignore this) |

The full text of each file is concatenated and injected into the system prompt before the first LLM call. Each source is separated by a heading so content is traceable. When both `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` exist at the same path, `CLAUDE.md` takes precedence.

`discover_subtree_instructions()` performs a **downward pass** from CWD to a maximum depth of 5, scanning for `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Content is **not** injected; only paths are. The system prompt receives an index like:

```
# Sub-package instruction files
- packages/mewbo_core/CLAUDE.md
- apps/mewbo_console/CLAUDE.md
```

When a later tool call targets a file inside `packages/mewbo_core/`, the model's next prediction produces a `read_file` call that pulls the relevant `CLAUDE.md` into the message array as a tool result. This keeps large monorepos manageable. Only directly applicable instructions occupy the active context.

Pruned directories (never walked): `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `venv`, and all dotfile directories. A `<!-- mewbo:noload -->` marker on line 1 of any instruction file excludes it from both passes.

`get_git_context()` collects branch, working-tree status, and recent commits. It is available as a helper; individual integrations decide whether to include it.

---

## Skill loading {#skill-loading}

Skills use a two-stage lazy-load pattern. A catalog (name + description only) is injected into the system prompt at session start. The full `SKILL.md` body enters the message array as a `ToolMessage` only when `activate_skill` is called.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Session
    participant MessageArray as Message array (state)
    participant Model as LLM inference
    participant SkillFS as Skill files

    Session->>SkillFS: discover_skills() at startup
    Session->>MessageArray: inject catalog into system prompt
    Note over MessageArray: state: catalog present, no skill bodies
    MessageArray->>Model: bind_tools + messages
    Model->>MessageArray: activate_skill(skill_name) tool call
    MessageArray->>SkillFS: load SKILL.md body, run shell preprocessing
    SkillFS->>MessageArray: skill body as ToolMessage result
    Note over MessageArray: state: skill body now in context
    MessageArray->>Model: next bind_tools call includes skill body\nand scoped tool set
```

When `allowed-tools` is set on a skill, activation replaces the full tool list using the same `filter_specs()` mechanism that sub-agent spawning uses. Shell preprocessing (`` !`command` ``) executes each matched command (30-second timeout) and substitutes stdout into the body before it is handed to the model; errors become `[ERROR: ...]` placeholders.

The skill registry checks file modification times and reloads changed files between sessions. New skill directories appearing while the server runs are detected on the next scan.

---

## Capability overlay {#capability-overlay}

Capabilities are opaque string ids advertised by the client (e.g. `stlite`). They gate which agents and skills are visible to a given session. The model never sees a gated entry. The tool schema is not bound, the agent definition does not enter the spawn catalog, and the skill catalog line is omitted.

### Data flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Client request] -- X-Mewbo-Capabilities: stlite --> B[API route]
    B -- client_capabilities on context event --> C[SessionStore]
    C --> D[Orchestrator]
    D -- tuple str, ... --> E[ToolUseLoop]
    D -- session_capabilities --> F[AgentRegistry.visible_for]
    D -- session_capabilities --> G[SkillRegistry.list_auto_invocable<br/>SkillRegistry.list_user_invocable]
    F --> H[Spawn catalog / system prompt]
    G --> H
    E --> I[filter_specs on bound tool schema]
```

1. The HTTP layer reads `X-Mewbo-Capabilities` (comma-separated) and passes it through to session creation.
2. The value is persisted on the session's context event as `client_capabilities`. It survives compaction because it lives on the event transcript, not in the LLM message array.
3. `Orchestrator` reads the event once per session, normalises it through `parse_capabilities()`, and threads a `tuple[str, ...]` into the `ToolUseLoop` constructor. The tuple is immutable for the lifetime of the session.
4. `AgentRegistry.visible_for(session_capabilities)` and `SkillRegistry.list_auto_invocable(session_capabilities)` / `list_user_invocable(session_capabilities)` apply the filter at every render of their catalogs.

### Filter implementation

[`capabilities.py::filter_by_capabilities`](repo:packages/mewbo_core/src/mewbo_core/capabilities.py) is the single filter. An item whose `requires_capabilities` tuple is a subset of the session's set is included; an empty `requires_capabilities` is always included. Ordering and duplication of `session_capabilities` do not matter, as comparison uses set semantics.

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `parse_capabilities(raw)` | Normalise a header value, frontmatter field, or manifest field into a sorted, deduped, trimmed `tuple[str, ...]`. Accepts `None`, `str`, or `list[str]`; other shapes return `()`. |
| `filter_by_capabilities(items, session_capabilities)` | Return the subset of items visible to the session. |
| `overlay_capabilities(spec, extra)` | Return a copy of `spec` with `extra` unioned into its `requires_capabilities`. Used to fan a plugin-level capability out over every contributed agent and skill. |

### Sources of `requires_capabilities`

Capabilities can be declared at three levels. They are combined as a union at discovery time.

| Source | Where it lives | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `AgentDef` frontmatter | `---\nrequires-capabilities: [stlite]\n---` block in an `agents/*.md` file | Single agent |
| `SkillSpec` frontmatter | Same block in a `SKILL.md` file | Single skill |
| Plugin manifest | `"requires-capabilities": ["stlite"]` in `plugin.json` | Every agent and skill the plugin contributes |

Plugin-level declarations are applied via `overlay_capabilities()` during discovery: the plugin's capabilities are unioned onto each contributed spec before the spec enters the registry. Authors never repeat a bundle-level capability per file.

### Tool gating

Session tools bound to a gated agent are also hidden. When a session does not advertise `stlite`, the `st-widget-builder` agent is not in the spawn catalog, so the `submit_widget` session tool is never instantiated. No tool-schema filtering is required at the `filter_specs()` level for this path. The agent gate is upstream of binding.

---

## Sub-agents and the hypervisor {#sub-agents}

Every session has a single `AgentHypervisor` instance shared across the entire agent tree. It has two layers.

**Reflexes (code-level watchdog).** A background check runs every 30 seconds. It examines all running agents for stalls (no tool call within the stall threshold, default 120 s). When a stall is detected, a `SystemMessage` warning is injected into the stalled agent's queue. Budget enforcement is similarly graduated. As `session_step_budget` is approached, warnings are injected. The loop is never hard-killed. This preserves accumulated context.

**Brain (global eye).** The root agent's system prompt is rebuilt each step. It includes `render_agent_tree()`, a compact live view of the entire agent tree. The tree shows status, steps completed, last tool, and progress notes. The root can read this at any time via `check_agents` without an extra LLM call. Compaction events are tracked per agent (`compaction_count`, `last_compacted_at`) and visible in the tree view.

### Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> submitted : spawn_agent called
    submitted --> running : execution begins
    running --> completed : natural completion (no tool calls)
    running --> failed : unhandled exception
    running --> cancelled : steer_agent cancel / parent cancelled
    running --> rejected : admission control (max_concurrent reached)
    completed --> [*]
    failed --> [*]
    cancelled --> [*]
    rejected --> [*]
```

Agents run until the model returns a text response with no tool calls. This is **natural completion**. There is no hard step limit. Safety comes from `agent.llm_call_timeout`, stall detection, and `agent.session_step_budget`.

### Spawning semantics

Root spawns (depth = 0) are non-blocking: the call returns `{agent_id, status: "submitted"}` immediately and `_run_child_lifecycle` stores the `AgentResult` on the `AgentHandle` when the child finishes. Sub-agent spawns (depth ≥ 1) are blocking and return an `AgentResult` JSON payload inline.

`spawn_agent(task, model, allowed_tools, denied_tools, acceptance_criteria, agent_type)` is the full signature. The `max_steps` parameter is deprecated and not enforced. Sub-agents inherit the parent's `approval_callback` so write, edit, and shell tools work in API and headless contexts.

### AgentResult

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `content` | string | Primary output text |
| `status` | string | `completed`, `failed`, `partial`, or `cannot_solve` |
| `steps_used` | integer | Number of tool steps executed |
| `summary` | string | Compressed summary (≤ 500 chars) for parent context |
| `warnings` | array | Non-fatal issues encountered |
| `artifacts` | array | File paths touched by the agent |

### Depth roles

Each depth level has a distinct behavioural role injected into the system prompt via `_build_depth_guidance()`:

| Depth | Role | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (root) | Hypervisor / orchestrator | Direct execution by default; async delegation when spawning; steer / cancel running agents; synthesize results |
| 1–4 (mid) | Sub-orchestrator | Bounded scope; may further delegate |
| 5 (leaf) | Executor | Complete task directly; self-terminate; admit failure explicitly |

At depth 5 the `spawn_agent` tool is removed from the schema entirely. The LLM cannot attempt further delegation.

### Messaging

| Direction | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Parent → child | `steer_agent` (root only) or `send_message(agent_id, text)` |
| Child → parent | Automatic on completion via `send_to_parent(child_id, text)` |
| System → agent | Hypervisor injects budget warnings and stall nudges as `HumanMessage` |
| User → root | `message_queue` (thread-safe `queue.Queue`), `interrupt_step` (`threading.Event`). Drained between steps as `HumanMessage`. Exposed via `/message` and `/interrupt`. Created in `RunRegistry.start()`. |

Messages are drained between tool steps. They never interrupt an in-flight tool call.

### Compaction resilience

Sub-agent state survives compaction because it lives outside the LLM conversation history. The agent tree is rebuilt each step into the root system prompt from live `AgentHandle` state. `check_agents` reads `AgentHandle` directly in memory. Completed child results are stored on `AgentHandle.result` and re-injected after compaction. Compaction never loses track of running or completed sub-agents.

### Cleanup and structured errors

Cleanup runs in three phases (cancel → wait with timeout → force-mark as cancelled). `await_lifecycle_managers(timeout)` runs before event-loop teardown. `AgentError` captures `agent_id`, `depth`, `task`, `message`, `last_tool`, `steps`. Sub-agent cleanup cascades to children before unregistering.

On root step-limit with pending non-blocking children, a 2-second grace period applies before completed results are injected as a `SystemMessage` for synthesis; still-running agents are named in the warning prompt.

---

## Permission policy {#permission-policy}

Every tool call is represented as an `ActionStep` with a `tool_id` and an `operation` (e.g. `get`, `set`). Before the tool runs, `PermissionPolicy.decide()` walks a list of `PermissionRule` entries and returns `allow`, `deny`, or `ask`. Rules are evaluated in order; the first match wins.

Matching uses `fnmatch` glob patterns on both `tool_id` and `operation`. If no rule matches, the policy falls back to per-operation defaults (`get` → `allow`, `set` → `ask`), then to a catch-all `default_decision`.

`permissions.approval_mode` sets a session-wide shortcut that overrides the policy file: `allow` (also `auto`, `approve`, `yes`), `deny` (also `never`, `no`), or `ask` (default).

---

## Policies {#policies}

Policies hook into the **pre-execution gate** inside the tool-use loop: after MCP input coercion and the permission check, but before the pre-tool hook fires and before the tool itself executes. This is the single authoritative intercept point: no tool can execute without passing through it.

When a resolved tool call matches an active policy's greylist, the loop:

1. Captures the fully-resolved tool call.
2. Starts an **isolated single-turn LLM invocation** with minimal context: the policy body and only the exception-structure tool are available. The checker cannot see the session's conversation history.
3. If the checker returns nothing, the call proceeds normally. If it calls the exception tool, the call is blocked and the exception text is returned to the agent as the tool result.
4. If `isTerminal: true` and a violation fires, the session ends immediately after the exception is delivered.

Multiple policies matching the same call run concurrently. A policy violation from any one of them is sufficient to block the call; all concurrent checks must clear for execution to proceed.

`PolicyRegistry` mirrors `SkillRegistry` in structure: a catalog is advertised at session start, and individual policy bodies are loaded lazily. Policy files live alongside skill files and are discovered through the same scan paths.

---

## Monitors {#monitors}

Monitors are spawned in the `on_session_start` hook and torn down in `on_session_end`. Each monitor is a **restricted tool-use loop session** tracked by the hypervisor as a peer of regular sub-agents: it has its own `AgentHandle`, lifecycle states, and token accounting. Monitors never appear in the agent tree visible to the root agent.

The monitor's tool set is hard-restricted at the tool-registry level before the session is constructed. Only `inject_message`, `interrupt_session`, and any tools listed in the monitor definition's `allowed-tools` are registered. The periodic invocation loop receives a read-only snapshot of the full agent tree at each tick as a structured `SystemMessage`.

| Tool | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| `inject_message` | Routes through `AgentHypervisor.send_message()` to the target agent's queue; drained between tool steps |
| `interrupt_session` | Sets a checked signal on the target loop's step boundary; never interrupts an in-flight tool call |

Crashed monitors are automatically respawned by the hypervisor after a short backoff. A monitor that crashes repeatedly is marked `failed` and not retried for the remainder of the session.

`MonitorRegistry` mirrors `PolicyRegistry` and `SkillRegistry`. Monitor definitions ship as files in the standard scan paths and are loaded at session init.

---

## Hook manager {#hook-manager}

`HookManager` dispatches hooks at lifecycle points and around individual tool calls. Every invocation is wrapped in `try/except`. A failing hook logs a warning and never blocks execution. `HookManager.load_from_config()` wires external hooks declared in `HooksConfig` into the manager. The API server calls this at startup and passes `hook_manager` to every `start_async()` call.

Two hook types:

- **Command hooks.** Shell subprocess. `_session_env()` provides `MEWBO_SESSION_ID`, `MEWBO_ERROR`, `MEWBO_TOOL_ID`, `MEWBO_OPERATION`, and `MEWBO_TOOL_RESULT` (first 2 000 chars). Waits up to `timeout` seconds (default 30), then moves on.
- **HTTP hooks.** Fire-and-forget JSON POST to an external URL in a daemon thread. Does not block execution. Failures are logged.

An optional `matcher` (fnmatch pattern) restricts which tool IDs trigger the hook. `matcher: "mcp__*"` restricts to all MCP tools; omitting the matcher matches every call.

Lifecycle events: `on_session_start`, `on_session_end`, `pre_tool_use`, `post_tool_use`. `on_compact` is fired programmatically from the compaction path. It is not configurable via `HooksConfig` but can be registered in code.

---

## Plan mode signals {#plan-mode}

In plan mode, the LLM binds only read-only tools plus the `exit_plan_mode` signal. Writes are blocked. Once the model calls `exit_plan_mode`, `ToolUseLoop` emits a `plan_proposed` event and terminates the run, waiting for a decision.

Approval emits `plan_approved` and starts a new act-mode run. Rejection emits `plan_rejected`. Free-text feedback is provided to the model as context for a revised plan.

Plan approval is **episodic**: approval and rejection events persist in the session transcript and survive process restarts. `SessionRuntime.resolve_session()` checks for unresolved `plan_proposed` events before starting a new run.

Each `exit_plan_mode` call increments a per-session counter stored at `<plan_dir>/revision.txt`. The revision number appears in `plan_proposed` events so the UI can distinguish between first drafts and revised plans.

### Shell allowlist

During exploration Mewbo enforces a shell allowlist via `agent.plan_mode_shell_allowlist`. Only commands whose first token matches a configured prefix are permitted. Commands containing an unquoted pipe (`|`), redirect (`>`, `<`), chain (`&`, `;`), variable expansion (`$`), or command substitution (`` ` ``) are rejected regardless of the allowlist. Prefixes match at word boundaries. For example, `"git log"` matches `"git log --oneline"` but not `"git logger"`. An empty list blocks shell access entirely.

`agent.plan_mode_allow_mcp` defaults to `true`; MCP tools are available in plan mode unless explicitly disabled.

---

## Compaction pipeline {#compaction}

Compaction has two modes:

- **`PARTIAL`**: default for auto-compact. Keeps the most recent `context.recent_event_limit` events verbatim (default 8). Everything older is summarised.
- **`FULL`**: summarises the entire transcript, including recent events. Clean-slate prompt.

The compaction LLM receives the raw event transcript and produces a structured response in two XML sections:

```xml
<analysis>
  [Reasoning about what to preserve vs discard. Removed before storing.]
</analysis>

<summary>
## Primary Request
## Key Technical Concepts
## Files and Code
## Errors and Fixes
## Current State
## Pending Tasks
</summary>
```

Only the `<summary>` block is stored. The `<analysis>` scratchpad is stripped before injection into subsequent prompts.

After the summary is generated, Mewbo scans summarised events for file paths referenced by tool calls and re-reads up to 5 files (up to 5 000 tokens each) back into the compacted context. Recently edited files land in the prompt as literal content so the model can continue editing without re-reading them.

**Caveman mode** (`compaction.caveman_mode = true`) activates a terse summarisation prompt. It drops articles, filler phrases, and hedging. Code blocks, file paths, URLs, commands, and error strings are preserved verbatim. Output tokens drop by ~30–60 % on prose-heavy sessions without changing the XML structure.

Each compaction emits a `context_compacted` event with payload `{model, tokens_before, tokens_saved, events_summarized}`. The console timeline renders compaction events as a distinct pill. The context-window bar popover includes a **Compactions** row when at least one has run.

Auto-compact fires when the most recent root prompt size crosses `token_budget.auto_compact_threshold` (default 0.8 of the model's context window). The threshold is evaluated after every LLM call using the actual `input_tokens` reported by the provider. This is not a character-count estimate.

---

## Token tracking {#token-tracking}

Mewbo tracks usage separately for the root agent (depth = 0) and all sub-agents (depth ≥ 1). Three distinct input-token semantics:

| Semantic | Fields | When to use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Context fill (now) | `root_last_input_tokens` | Current window pressure. Drives the fill bar and "until compact" display. |
| Context pressure (peak) | `root_peak_input_tokens`, `sub_peak_input_tokens` | Worst-case historical pressure. Popover secondary stat. |
| Billable (cost) | `*_input_tokens_billed` | Cumulative sum across all calls. Cost dashboards. |

Do **not** sum `input_tokens` across calls within a turn. The prompt grows as tool results accumulate. Each step re-sends the full context, so summing double-counts the baseline. Use the peak or the last value. Output tokens are always additive. Each output token is produced once.

Prompt caching auto-enables via LiteLLM for models that report support. No configuration is required. Mewbo queries `litellm.utils.supports_prompt_caching` to decide whether to enable caching for a given model name.

When using a proxy (`llm.api_base` set), the proxy must expose `/v1/model/info` advertising each model's capabilities. Mewbo fetches this endpoint once per process at startup and registers the results with LiteLLM so `supports_prompt_caching` returns accurate results for proxy-routed custom model names. Without `/v1/model/info`, caching falls back to disabled for those models.

---

## MCP connection pool {#mcp}

MCP server definitions are assembled from four layers, merged deepest-first with deep-merge semantics (later layers win on key conflicts):

| Layer | Source | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Plugin-contributed servers | Lowest |
| 2 | Global: `configs/mcp.json` or `$MEWBO_HOME/mcp.json` | Middle |
| 3 | Subtree `.mcp.json` files, deepest-first | Middle |
| 4 | CWD `.mcp.json` | Highest |

The session's project directory is passed as `cwd` to `MCPToolRunner`. Each `connect_all` call re-invokes `get_merged_mcp_config(cwd)` and hashes the merged result with SHA-256; changed or new servers reconnect, removed servers disconnect, unchanged servers keep their existing connections.

### Config normalization

All `.mcp.json` files are normalised before merging:

| Input field | Normalized to | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| `mcpServers` | `servers` | Claude Code / VS Code schema compatibility |
| `type` | `transport` | Both removed after normalization to avoid leaks |
| `http_headers` | `headers` | Key rename |
| `transport: "http"` | `transport: "streamable_http"` | Legacy alias |
| `command` present, no `transport` | `transport: "stdio"` | Inferred |
| `${VAR}` / `$VAR` in values | Expanded from process environment | Unresolved vars left as-is |

### Pool behaviour

| Behaviour | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Persistent connections | One `MultiServerMCPClient` per server, reused across all requests. |
| Auto-reconnect | After 3 consecutive call errors on a server, the pool invalidates it and attempts a single reconnect before retrying the failed call. |
| Config change detection | Config hash is compared on each `connect_all` call. |
| Connect timeout | 30 seconds per server. |
| Call timeout | 60 seconds per tool invocation. |
| Concurrent connects | Up to 5 servers connect in parallel at startup. |

The legacy one-shot client is a fallback when the pool is unavailable.

---

## LSP tool {#lsp}

`lsp_tool` is backed by `pygls` and `lsprotocol`. When these optional dependencies are absent, the tool is silently disabled on startup. There is no crash and no error.

Servers are auto-discovered via `shutil.which`. They are spawned lazily per-session on the first request for a matching file type. A server that fails to start is added to a `_failed` set. It is not retried for the lifetime of the session. `shutdown_all()` terminates running servers at session end.

The manager walks up from CWD looking for each server's `root_markers`. If no marker is found within 20 directory levels, CWD itself becomes the workspace root.

Passive diagnostics run via an `_append_lsp_feedback` hook inside `ToolUseLoop` after every file edit. The diagnostics are appended to the context as a tool result. The LLM sees type errors and lint warnings in the same turn it wrote the edit, with no explicit `lsp_tool` call required. Disable by setting `agent.lsp.enabled` to `false`.

Custom servers defined under `agent.lsp.servers` specify `command`, `extensions`, and optionally `root_markers` and `language_id`. Disable a built-in server with `{"pyright": {"disabled": true}}`.

---

## Web IDE manager {#web-ide}

`IdeManager` manages per-session code-server containers. State is persisted in the `ide_instances` MongoDB collection so the IDE survives API restarts and multiple browser tabs. The Web IDE feature requires MongoDB as the storage backend.

The API container needs access to the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) to spawn sibling code-server containers. In the Docker Compose stack this is wired automatically.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Console
    participant API
    participant IdeManager
    participant MongoDB
    participant Docker

    User->>Console: Click "Open in Web IDE"
    Console->>API: POST /api/sessions/{id}/ide
    API->>IdeManager: ensure(session_id, project_name, project_path)
    IdeManager->>MongoDB: Insert IdeInstance doc
    IdeManager->>Docker: containers.run(code-server image)
    Docker-->>IdeManager: container running
    IdeManager-->>API: (instance, created=True)
    API-->>Console: { url, password, status: "starting" }
    Console->>User: Open /ide/{id}/ in new tab
```

The session's project directory is mounted at `/home/coder/project`. A deadline file is bind-mounted at `/mewbo/deadline`. The container's internal watchdog reads it on a 15-second interval and self-terminates when the epoch passes. [`POST /api/sessions/{id}/ide/extend`](endpoint:POST /api/sessions/{id}/ide/extend) overwrites the deadline file and updates MongoDB. `DELETE` force-removes the container, deadline file, and MongoDB document.

---

## Built-in tools {#built-in-tools}

### read_file cache

`read_file` maintains a per-session cache keyed by `(path, offset, limit)`. If the session calls `read_file` on the same slice twice without any intervening edit to that file, the second call returns immediately from cache. It does not re-read or re-emit the content into the context window. In real sessions this cuts 60–99 % of context consumed by repeated reads of the same large file.

### Tool output schemas

Each built-in tool returns a JSON payload tagged with `kind`:

```json
// read_file
{"kind": "file", "path": "...", "text": "1\t...", "total_lines": 42}

// aider_shell_tool
{"kind": "shell", "command": "...", "cwd": "...", "exit_code": 0,
 "stdout": "...", "stderr": "", "duration_ms": 423}

// aider_list_dir_tool
{"kind": "dir", "path": "...", "entries": ["..."]}

// aider_edit_block_tool / file_edit_tool
{"kind": "diff", ...}
```

### Edit tool selection

Both edit backends share [`edit_common.py`](repo:packages/mewbo_tools/src/mewbo_tools/integration/edit_common.py) and emit `{"kind": "diff", ...}`. `AgentConfig.edit_tool` selects `"search_replace_block"` or `"structured_patch"`. When empty (default), `ToolUseLoop._configured_edit_tool_id()` auto-selects based on model identity via `llm.model_prefers_structured_patch()`. The tool schema, LLM prompt instructions, and backend implementation all switch together. They are bundled in the same `ToolSpec` registration.

Extend which models receive the structured-patch backend via `llm.structured_patch_models` (accepts wildcards): `["my-custom-model*", "openai/gpt-5"]`.

## Plugin loading {#plugins}

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Session init] --> B[load_all_plugin_components]
    B --> C[Read installed_plugins.json from registry paths]
    C --> D[Discover components for each plugin]
    D --> E[Load skill_dirs into SkillRegistry]
    D --> F[Load agent_files into AgentRegistry]
    D --> G[Merge mcp_config into MCP server map]
    D --> H[Merge hooks_config into HooksConfig]
    E & F & G & H --> I[Session ready: all plugin components active]
```

`load_all_plugin_components()` runs during session initialisation. It reads the installed-plugins registry file, discovers each plugin's directory, and fans contributions into the live registries. The result is cached by registry-file mtime. Repeated calls within the same process are free unless a plugin was installed or uninstalled.

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in a plugin's `.mcp.json` or `hooks/hooks.json` is substituted at discovery time with the plugin's installation directory.

**Precedence.** Plugin skills do not override personal (`~/.claude/skills/`) or project-local (`.claude/skills/`) skills with the same name. Plugin MCP servers are merged additively. Later plugins do not overwrite earlier ones for the same server name. Plugin hooks are format-translated and merged into the live `HooksConfig`.

`PluginsConfig` lives in `config.py` and defines `registry_paths` and `marketplaces`. The CLI exposes `/plugins`; the API exposes `GET/POST /api/plugins`, `GET/POST /api/plugins/marketplace`, and [`DELETE /api/plugins/<name>`](endpoint:DELETE /api/plugins/<name>); the console renders `PluginsView`.

See [Session tools](#session-tools) for plugin-contributed per-agent stateful tools.

### Built-in plugin scan path

A fourth scan source sits alongside the registry-driven paths: the directory [`packages/mewbo_core/src/mewbo_core/builtin_plugins/`](repo:packages/mewbo_core/src/mewbo_core/builtin_plugins). Any plugin checked in under this path is discovered through the **same** pipeline as user-installed and marketplace-installed plugins. It is byte-for-byte a normal plugin (manifest, `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `.mcp.json`, `session_tools`) with no `installed_plugins.json` entry required.

The path is resolved at runtime via `importlib.resources.files("mewbo_core") / "builtin_plugins"` so discovery works identically for editable installs (`pip install -e .`), wheels, and zipapps. The scanner iterates every immediate subdirectory that contains a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

Currently bundled: `widget_builder/` (declares `requires-capabilities: ["stlite"]`). Other bundles slot in by dropping a plugin-shaped directory next to it. No discovery code needs to change.

### Path substitution

Plugin-owned agent bodies and skill bodies can reference three placeholders. Substitution is a single linear `str.replace` pass per placeholder. There is no template engine, no expression language, and bodies with no placeholders are byte-identical after the pass.

| Placeholder | Resolved at | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | Plugin discovery | Absolute path to the plugin's install directory on disk |
| `${SESSION_ID}` | Agent spawn | The current session's id |
| `${MEWBO_WIDGET_ROOT}` | Agent spawn | Widget-builder output root; supports `:-` default syntax |

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is also substituted inside `.mcp.json` and `hooks/hooks.json` at discovery time, as noted above. `${SESSION_ID}` and `${MEWBO_WIDGET_ROOT}` are agent-body-only and resolve inside `spawn_agent` just before the body is handed to the child `ToolUseLoop`.

## Session tools {#session-tools}

A **session tool** is a per-agent stateful tool whose lifecycle is coupled to one specific agent instance rather than the global `ToolRegistry`. The handler holds state (accumulated across calls within the agent's run), declares its own OpenAI function schema, and can signal clean loop termination independently of the model's final text response. The core `ExitPlanModeTool` is a session tool. The widget-builder's `SubmitWidgetTool` is a session tool contributed by a plugin.

Session tools are defined in [`session_tools.py`](repo:packages/mewbo_core/src/mewbo_core/session_tools.py).

### Protocol

```python
class SessionTool(Protocol):
    tool_id: str
    schema: dict[str, object]
    modes: frozenset[str]

    async def handle(self, action_step: ActionStep) -> MockSpeaker: ...
    def should_terminate_run(self) -> bool: ...
```

| Member | Role |
|---|---|
| `tool_id` | Dispatch key. Must match the name the LLM sees in the bound schema. |
| `schema` | OpenAI function schema (identical shape to any other bound tool). |
| `modes` | Frozenset of orchestration modes (`"plan"` / `"act"`) the tool is valid in. Plugin tools default to `DEFAULT_SESSION_TOOL_MODES` = `{"act"}`; `ExitPlanModeTool` overrides to `{"plan"}`. |
| `handle(action_step)` | Executes the call, returns a `MockSpeaker` with the tool result (consumed like any `ToolMessage`). |
| `should_terminate_run()` | Returns `True` (once, consuming the flag) when the loop should exit cleanly after the current step. |

### Registry and factories

`SessionToolRegistry` holds one `SessionToolFactory` per `tool_id`. A factory is `Callable[[session_id, event_logger], SessionTool]`. Construction is cheap and happens per agent.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Plugin as "plugin.json"
    participant Core as Session init
    participant Reg as SessionToolRegistry
    participant Loop as ToolUseLoop
    participant Tool as SessionTool instance

    Core->>Plugin: read session_tools[] entries
    loop for each entry
        Core->>Reg: load_entry({tool_id, module, cls})
        Reg->>Reg: importlib.import_module + getattr<br/>register SessionToolFactory
    end
    Note over Reg: factories populated, no instances yet
    Loop->>Reg: build_for(agent.allowed_tools, session_id, event_logger)
    Reg->>Tool: factory(session_id, event_logger)
    Tool-->>Loop: SessionTool instance
    Loop->>Loop: inject schema, wire dispatch,<br/>check should_terminate_run each step
```

### Plugin contract

Plugins contribute session tools via a `session_tools` array in `plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "session_tools": [
    {
      "tool_id": "submit_widget",
      "module": "mewbo_core.builtin_plugins.widget_builder.submit_widget",
      "class": "SubmitWidgetTool"
    }
  ]
}
```

`SessionToolRegistry.load_entry()` imports the class at session start and registers a factory. `build_for(allowed_tools, …)` instantiates one per-agent instance when an agent spawns with a matching `tool_id` in its `allowed_tools`. A broken plugin (missing fields, import error, constructor raises) is logged and skipped. It never crashes the host session.

### Loop integration

Inside `ToolUseLoop`, schema injection, dispatch, and termination all iterate a single `list[SessionTool]`. Core's built-in session tools and plugin-contributed ones are handled by the same three call sites. There is no widget-specific branch; the only asymmetry is the built-in set (just `ExitPlanModeTool` today) versus the plugin-loaded set. Gated agents (see [Capability overlay](#capability-overlay)) never reach `build_for`, so a plugin session tool on a hidden agent is never instantiated.

## Channel adapters {#channel-adapters}

Chat-platform adapters implement the `ChannelAdapter` protocol ([`channels/base.py`](repo:apps/mewbo_api/src/mewbo_api/channels/base.py)):

| Method / property | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `verify_request` | Authenticate an inbound request (HMAC for webhooks) |
| `parse_inbound` | Produce a normalised `InboundMessage` |
| `send_response` | Deliver the final answer back to the channel |
| `system_context` | Injected into the LLM system prompt. Makes the model aware it is communicating through this adapter |

`ChannelRegistry` lookup and `DeduplicationGuard` replay protection are shared. The webhook endpoint [`POST /api/webhooks/<platform>`](endpoint:POST /api/webhooks/<platform>) authenticates via HMAC (not API key). Poll-driven channels (e.g. Email) call `_process_inbound()` directly from their own poller instead of via the webhook route.

The shared `_process_inbound()` pipeline in [`routes.py`](repo:apps/mewbo_api/src/mewbo_api/channels/routes.py) runs dedup → mention gate → session resolve → commands → LLM for every channel. `requires_mention(message)` is optional on the adapter for dynamic mention gating (Email uses this to skip the `@Mewbo` requirement on 1-to-1 threads).

Channel sessions are standard API sessions. They are created via `session_store.create_session()`, mapped via session tags (`tag_session` / `resolve_tag`), and visible in the console and Langfuse. The completion callback reads `source_platform` from the transcript context event and dispatches the final answer through the adapter.

Existing adapters: Nextcloud Talk ([`nextcloud_talk.py`](repo:apps/mewbo_api/src/mewbo_api/channels/nextcloud_talk.py), HMAC-SHA256, ActivityStreams 2.0, OCS Bot API) and Email ([`email_adapter.py`](repo:apps/mewbo_api/src/mewbo_api/channels/email_adapter.py), IMAP polling + SMTP reply, markdown-to-HTML rendering via `mistune`, Jinja2 HTML template).
