The Nextcloud Talk integration allows users to interact with Mewbo directly from any Nextcloud Talk conversation. Mention the bot and it responds, creating a standard Mewbo session visible in the web console and Langfuse traces.

## How it works

1. A Nextcloud Talk bot is registered on the server pointing to the Mewbo API webhook endpoint.
2. When a user @mentions the bot, Nextcloud POSTs an ActivityStreams 2.0 webhook to [`POST /api/webhooks/nextcloud-talk`](endpoint:POST /api/webhooks/nextcloud-talk).
3. The adapter verifies the HMAC-SHA256 signature, parses the message, and creates or continues a session.
4. Non-mentioned messages are silently ignored. The bot only responds when triggered.
5. When the session completes, the final answer is sent back via the Nextcloud OCS Bot API with `replyTo` (creating a visual quote link).

### Session model

- **Room-scoped**: All @mentions in the same room share one persistent session. Tag format: `nextcloud-talk:room:<room_token>`.
- **Thread-scoped**: Messages with a `threadId` (explicit NC Talk thread) get their own session. Tag format: `nextcloud-talk:thread:<room_token>:<thread_id>`.
- Sessions are standard API sessions. They are stored in MongoDB/JSON, visible in the console, and support forking, archiving, and export.

## Slash commands

Commands are available after the @mention keyword. They run without invoking the LLM.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands and usage |
| `/usage` | Show session token usage, context window utilization, and compaction status |
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation (clears current session context) |
| `/switch-project <name>` | Switch the active project context for this session |

Examples:
```
@Mewbo /help
@Mewbo /usage
@Mewbo /new
@Mewbo /switch-project personal-assistant
```

The `/switch-project` command sets the working directory for subsequent LLM runs. If the project name is invalid or omitted, it lists available projects.

## Prerequisites

- Nextcloud 27.1+ with Talk 17.1+ (for bots-v1 capability)
- Nextcloud 32+ with Talk 22+ (for thread support via `threadId`)
- The Mewbo API server running and reachable from the Nextcloud instance

## Setup

### 1. Register the bot in Nextcloud

On the Nextcloud server (requires admin shell access):

```bash
occ talk:bot:install "Mewbo" \
  "<shared-secret-at-least-40-chars>" \
  "https://<mewbo-api-host>/api/webhooks/nextcloud-talk" \
  --feature webhook --feature response \
  "AI assistant with a conversation state machine and agent hypervisor"
```

Note the shared secret. It must match the `bot_secret` in the Mewbo config.

### 2. Enable the bot in conversations

Either via the admin CLI:

```bash
occ talk:bot:setup <bot-id> <conversation-token>
```

Or via the Nextcloud Talk web UI (moderator role required): open the conversation settings and enable the bot under "Bots".

### 3. Configure Mewbo

Add the channel config to `configs/app.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "nextcloud-talk": {
      "enabled": true,
      "bot_secret": "<shared-secret-from-step-1>",
      "nextcloud_url": "https://cloud.example.com",
      "allowed_backends": ["https://cloud.example.com"],
      "trigger_keyword": "@Mewbo",
      "nextcloud_host_header": ""
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Set to `true` to activate the adapter |
| `bot_secret` | Shared HMAC secret from `occ talk:bot:install` |
| `nextcloud_url` | Base URL of the Nextcloud instance (use internal URL if behind a CDN) |
| `allowed_backends` | Origin allowlist for the `X-Nextcloud-Talk-Backend` header (recommended) |
| `trigger_keyword` | Literal keyword that must appear in a message to trigger the bot (default: `@Mewbo`) |
| `nextcloud_host_header` | Optional `Host` header override for outbound requests (useful when `nextcloud_url` is an internal address) |

### 4. Restart the API server

```bash
uv run mewbo-api
# or: docker compose restart api
```

The startup logs should show:

```
Nextcloud Talk channel adapter registered
Channel webhook routes registered (platforms: ['nextcloud-talk'])
```

## Usage

In any Nextcloud Talk conversation where the bot is enabled:

```
@Mewbo help me refactor the auth module
```

The bot responds with the orchestration result. Subsequent @mentions in the same room continue the conversation with full context. Use `/new` to reset.

## Limitations

- **File attachments**: the bot receives file metadata but cannot download file content (requires Nextcloud user auth, not bot auth). File sending is not supported by the NC Talk Bot API.
- **DM auto-respond**: the bot requires @mention in all rooms (no automatic DM detection yet).
- **Emoji reactions for status**: not yet implemented.
