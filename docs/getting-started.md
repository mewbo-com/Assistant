# Get Started

Mewbo runs as a local CLI, a REST API + web console, or a containerised stack. Pick the path that fits your setup.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Python 3.10+ | [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) manages the virtualenv |
| Node.js 18+ | Console frontend only |
| Docker | Optional, for container deployment |

## Installation {#installation}

### CLI {#cli-setup}

The CLI is the fastest way to start a local session.

```bash
uv sync
uv run mewbo
```

The CLI is part of the base install. No extra is needed.

For a global install so `mewbo` works from anywhere:
```bash
uv tool install .
```

See [CLI client](clients-cli.md) for usage details, slash commands, and approval modes.

### API + Console {#api-setup}

The REST API and web console run as two separate processes.

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
uv sync --extra api

# Install console frontend dependencies (once)
cd apps/mewbo_console && npm install && cd -

# Start the API
uv run mewbo-api

# Start the console (separate terminal)
cd apps/mewbo_console && npm run dev
```

The dev console proxies `/api/` requests to the API at `127.0.0.1:5124` by default. That is the API's local port. Port 5125 is the Docker host port only (see the [Docker quick-start](#docker-quickstart)).

See [Console + API](clients-web-api.md) for configuration, auth, and session management.

### Home Assistant {#ha-setup}

Adds the Home Assistant tool for smart-home control via the CLI or API.

```bash
uv sync --extra ha
```

Then set `home_assistant.enabled` and credentials in `configs/app.json`. See [Home Assistant](clients-home-assistant.md).

### All extras (developer) {#dev-setup}

Installs every optional component plus test/docs tooling.

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --all-groups
```

The CLI and core tools ship with the base install. The optional extras are:

| Extra | What it adds |
|-------|-------------|
| `api` | REST API server (Flask, Flask-RESTX, Gunicorn), the backend for the web console |
| `ha` | Home Assistant conversation integration |
| `wiki` | Wiki + search graph substrate via `mewbo-graph` (tree-sitter, rank-bm25, numpy) |
| `mcp` | Standalone MCP server wrapping the REST API |
| `--all-extras` | All of the above |
| `--all-groups` | Dev + test + docs groups |

## Configuration {#configuration}

Mewbo loads config files from the first directory that contains them, checked in order:

1. `CWD/configs/`: project-local config (highest priority)
2. `$MEWBO_HOME/`: custom home dir if set
3. `~/.mewbo/`: user home fallback

Bootstrap from the example template:

```bash
cp configs/app.example.json configs/app.json
```

The two files you'll edit most:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `configs/app.json` | Runtime settings, LLM keys, integrations |
| `configs/mcp.json` | MCP server definitions |

To scaffold both from scratch, run `/init` from the CLI after a bare `uv sync`.

- For LLM provider keys and model selection: [LLM Setup](llm-setup.md)
- For every config key: [Configuration Reference](configuration.md)

## First run {#first-run}

After copying and editing `configs/app.json`:

```bash
uv run mewbo
```

On first run, type `/init` to scaffold any missing config files. A minimal working `configs/app.json`:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "api_key": "sk-ant-xxxxxxxx",
    "default_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"
  }
}
```

All other keys have sensible defaults. The CLI will prompt for approval before any write or shell operation.

## Docker quick-start {#docker-quickstart}

Pre-built images are published to GHCR. This is the fastest path to a production-ready stack.

```bash
# 1. Create your environment file and edit the three required vars
cp docker.example.env docker.env

# 2. Pull and start
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Required variables in `docker.env`:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `MASTER_API_TOKEN` | API authentication token |
| `VITE_API_KEY` | Frontend key (must match `MASTER_API_TOKEN`) |
| `HOST_UID` / `HOST_GID` | Host user/group IDs (`id` to find yours) |

See [Docker Compose](deployment-docker.md) for the full reference: volume mounts, project directories, init scripts, reverse proxy, and runtime config.

## Project instructions {#project-instructions}

Mewbo discovers `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.claude/rules/*.md` files
automatically. The discovery is compatible with the Claude Code and AGENTS.md conventions.

Place a `CLAUDE.md` at your project root and it will be loaded at session start.
Nested packages are handled via an on-demand index: sub-directory instruction files
are listed in the system prompt as paths; their content is fetched via `read_file`
tool calls only when work reaches those directories.

See [Project Configuration](project-configuration.md) for the full loading strategy:
four priority levels, the upward/downward pass mechanics, the noload marker, and
how project-level `.mcp.json` files are merged.

## Git hooks {#git-hooks}

Use the repo-managed hook set to enforce commit message format and block pushes that fail linting or tests.

```bash
git config core.hooksPath scripts/githooks
```

Optional: install `pre-commit` hooks for local enforcement:
```bash
make precommit-install
```

Commit message format:
```text
<emoji> <verb>(<scope>): <message>
```

Pre-push checks run `scripts/ci/check.sh`. This covers ruff format/check, mypy, and pytest.
