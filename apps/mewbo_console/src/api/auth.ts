/**
 * The auth wire surface — `/api/auth/{me,login,logout}`.
 *
 * Four things about this seam are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **`/me` answers 200 even when auth is DISABLED**, carrying a
 *    full-power principal (`auth_enabled: false`, `subject: "svc:legacy"`,
 *    `roles: ["admin"]`). That is what lets every consumer render
 *    unconditionally instead of branching on a feature flag.
 * 2. **Login is a full-page navigation, not XHR.** `/api/auth/login` answers a
 *    302 to the identity provider; an `fetch` would follow it into a CORS wall
 *    and the user would never see the provider's consent screen.
 * 3. **Logout is a POST**, and it must carry cookies, because clearing the
 *    session cookie is the entire point.
 * 4. **`/me` is also the credential probe.** It is the one call that opts into
 *    `credentials: "include"` before the shared mode is raised; if it comes
 *    back, cookies demonstrably work on this deployment and every later call
 *    can carry them too. See `httpBase.ts` for why that has to be earned
 *    rather than assumed.
