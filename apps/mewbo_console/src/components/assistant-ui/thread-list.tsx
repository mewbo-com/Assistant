/**
 * Mewbo side-rail thread list, built on assistant-ui's `ThreadListPrimitive`.
 *
 * The rail reads its ordered/active thread list straight from the shared
 * external-store runtime (mounted once in `AppLayout` via `MewboRuntimeProvider`),
 * so the active row highlights and row-clicks/New route through the SAME seam the
 * composer uses — no bespoke list state. The runtime's thread data only carries
 * `{id, title}`, though; a row's provenance badge, project label and timestamp
 * come from `SessionSummary`, injected via `RailMetaProvider`. The default origin
 * filter (`isDefaultVisibleOrigin`) and the recents cap are applied here so the
 * rail shows the same user-facing set as the landing page.
 *
 * NB. The vendored assistant-ui source ships Tailwind v4 syntax that silently
 * no-ops on our v3.4 build — translated here: `data-active:` → `data-[active]:`
 * (the primitive emits `data-active="true"` on the active row) and every colour
 * routed through our `hsl(var(--token))` vocabulary.

/** One recents row: the vendor primitive owns click→switch + the active tint;
 *  we render Mewbo's compact single-line title with a trailing liveness dot.
 *
 *  Geometry, spacing, resting type and the focus ring come from the SHARED rail
 *  kit (`railRowCls` + `FOCUS_RING` in `nav-rail/rows.tsx`) — the same constants
 *  `RailRow` composes, so this row cannot drift from its Wiki/Search/Apps
 *  neighbours. Re-spelling the constants locally instead of importing them is
 *  exactly how a row drifts: it sat at `h-8` against the rail's `h-7` after a
 *  density change, rendering Tasks recents 4px taller than the rows directly
 *  above them.
 *
 *  Only COLOUR is supplied here, and that is the kit's design, not a shortfall:
 *  the assistant-ui primitive splits a row across `Root` (which owns the
 *  background, so it can carry `data-[active]`) and `Trigger` (which owns the
 *  text), so a row's idle/hover/active colours cannot live in one class string.
 *  The kit deliberately leaves colour out so this file COMPOSES it rather than
 *  overriding a baked-in default — overriding is how the drift would return.
 *
 *  What stays bespoke: this is the one rail list whose row must BE the
 *  assistant-ui primitive (to get click→switch and the active tint for free),
 *  so it cannot simply render `RailRow`. Structure differs; vocabulary no
 *  longer does. */
