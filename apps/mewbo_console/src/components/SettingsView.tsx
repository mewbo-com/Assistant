/**
 * SettingsView — the section pane for whichever facet the URL names.
 *
 * Used to also render its own facet sidebar; that's gone. The NavRail's
 * Settings zone (`nav-rail/settingsSection.tsx`) is the one facet picker now,
 * on every viewport, so this shell only READS `?facet=` — it never writes it.
 * The shell still OWNS edit state (a sectionId → formData map) so it can
 * drive the @modified filter and per-section Save/Reset; all grouping /
 * slicing / search / diff logic stays in `SettingsModel` — the shell never
 * recomputes it. Per-section patches are produced by `model.patchFor` and
 * persisted via `useConfig.savePatch`.
 *
 * The shell knows NO facet by name. A facet may carry schema-driven sections,
 * custom panes (`settings/panes.ts`), or both; panes render above sections,
 * each behind its own `<Suspense>`. Adding a pane is one line in `panes.ts`.
 *
 * The active facet is read from the URL as `?facet=<id>` (deep-linkable), and
 * a change re-focuses the pane heading — see the `previousFacetRef` effect.
