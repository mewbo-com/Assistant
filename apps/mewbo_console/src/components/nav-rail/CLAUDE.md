# NavRail — the console's single navigation surface

The rail is the ONLY site navigation. There is no top navigation bar anywhere, on any route, in any
mode, and nothing may reintroduce a horizontal chrome bar. Contextual needs live in slim in-pane
headers (`SessionHeader.tsx`, `WikiTopBar`, `AppDetailHeader`), never in global chrome. This file is
the rail's authority: anatomy, contracts and constraints.

## `rows.tsx` IS the rail vocabulary — hand-rolled rail chrome is a review reject

Section chrome, rows, and the metrics both are built from live in ONE module, imported by every
rail-like surface: the NavRail's own sections, the Apps instrument rail, the Agentic Search right
rail, the wiki's on-page ToC. **If the kit cannot express what a surface needs, the kit gains a prop
— it does not get forked.** Per-surface row markup cannot converge: each screen drifts on height,
focus ring and borders independently, and a fix applied to one leaves the next untouched.

| Export | What it is |
|---|---|
| `RailSection` | Section container: optional heading, the boundary above it, the gap below. A rail zone is a STACK of these |
| `RailSectionHeader` | The eyebrow alone (`icon`, `trailing`, `divider`), for when you don't want the container |
| `RailRow` | THE navigation row — recents, page trees, ToC entries. `leading`/`trailing`/`active`/`depth` |
| `RailActionRow` | The `h-8` icon+label action/product row |
| `RailDateGroup`, `RailEmpty` | Date bucket; calm empty state |
| `FOCUS_RING`, `railRowCls`, `railActionRowCls`, `railRowIconCls`, `railLabelIconCls`, `RAIL_PAD_X` | The metrics, for the one consumer that genuinely cannot render `RailRow` |

**The right-hand rails share the vocabulary, not the silhouette.** `agentic_search/RightRail`
renders the kit's section chrome directly. The Apps instrument rail shares the type ramp, glyph
sizes and `RailEmpty`, but its section chrome is a persisted Collapsible cluster with a collapsed
icon-strip mode — axes `RailSection` deliberately does not model — and its ROW
(`apps/railSections/rows.tsx`) is its own component. That boundary is considered, not drift: an
instrument row carries an `actions` slot, so making the whole row a `<button>` would nest
interactive elements (invalid HTML, broken for keyboard and AT); its anatomy is two-line where
`RailRow` is fixed-height single-line; and the console's shape law puts left surfaces at
`rounded-lg` and right-hand instrument surfaces at `rounded-md`. Merging them would need `as`,
`actions`, multi-line, tone and radius axes on one component — the variant explosion the kit exists
to avoid. **Share the tokens, not the silhouette.**

## Anatomy (top → bottom)

1. **Header** — BrandMark + wordmark + version. Click → `/`.
2. **Product switcher** — four action rows (Tasks `/` · Wiki `/wiki` · Search `/search` · Apps
   `/apps`). Selecting navigates to the product landing AND scopes section 3. Exactly one row
   carries `aria-current="page"`; a route mapping to no product (`/settings`) marks none — the rail
   still renders (never strand a route without primary nav).
3. **Scoped section** (the one scrollable zone) — **the contents of the current scope**: recents for
   a product, the FACET LIST for Settings. Read the zone as "what is inside where I am", not as
   "recents" — that is what lets `/settings` keep its navigation in the rail instead of showing
   another product's recents while the user is somewhere else. Each section is SELF-CONTAINED: calls
   its own hooks (TanStack dedupes by queryKey), navigates via wouter directly. `AppLayout` threads
   zero data props.
4. **Pinned footer — ONE bordered zone** (`RailFooter`). The account cluster and the notification
   feed share a single enclosure: the account menu (avatar → EXACTLY four rows: Settings ·
   Documentation · GitHub · theme toggle), then an icon-only notification bell (`NotificationBell`,
   count badge → the shared `NotificationPanel`), then the Settings gear. The menu is not a page
   index — adding a destination here is the smell; add a facet or a rail affordance instead. The feed
   is an icon, not a full-width row, which is what lets account and notifications share one zone.
   Expanded/mobile lay the cluster out as one horizontal row (`[account · bell · gear]`); collapsed stacks the bell above
   the avatar in the 48px rail, and the gear is absent there (Settings rides the avatar menu).

### Borders — the rail's two INTERNAL rules

The rail is a distinct canvas, so its INTERNAL zone boundaries have to be *stated*; a rail whose
zones dissolve into each other has no anatomy a user can read. Two rules, both on `--rail-border`:
above the product-scoped section, and above the footer — each on its wrapper in `RailContent`.

**The rail draws NO right edge of its own.** The content area renders as one rounded floating sheet
(`rounded-lg` + `--border` hairline + `--background`) flush against the rail on the `--rail-bg`
canvas, and that sheet's rounded edge, hairline, and the `--rail-bg`→`--background` colour step
(rail LIGHTER than the sheet in dark, DARKER in light) are three separation cues already. A
`border-r` on top of them is redundant and reads worst at the sheet's rounded corners, where a
straight rail line meets a curve. If the seam ever reads weak, strengthen the SHEET's own edge —
never redraw a rail line. The mobile `Sheet` is the ONE exception: it keeps `--border-strong`
because it floats over a scrim.

**The two internal rules ride `--rail-border`, never `--border`.** `--border` carries an alpha tuned
for hairlines *inside* a card; against the rail canvas the same value reads as no line at all — the
divider measures as present in the DOM and is invisible on screen.

**RULES are full-bleed; FILLS are not — this rules-vs-fills split is the load-bearing distinction.**
A `border-t` reaches the rail edges when its element spans the full rail width, and — the key fact —
a border on the SAME element as horizontal padding STILL spans full width, because the border sits
OUTSIDE padding (padding only insets a border it is an ANCESTOR of). A row's FILL (its rounded
hover/active pill) is the opposite: it must NEVER touch the rail edges, because a pill kissing the
viewport reads broken. So every zone carries a small `RAIL_GUTTER` (`px-1`, 4px) placed where it
insets fills but never rules:

- The product-switcher `nav` and the footer zone div hold `RAIL_GUTTER` DIRECTLY. Their `border-t`
  is on that same div, so it stays full-bleed while the rows inside float off the edges.
- The scoped-section wrapper stays padding-free (its own `border-t` is full-bleed), and the gutter
  lives INSIDE `RailSection`, on the rows wrapper. This is forced: the kit's `RailSectionHeader`
  dividers are CHILDREN of that section, so a `px` on any wrapper AROUND them insets every divider
  from the edges. The header sits OUTSIDE the gutter wrapper; only the rows float.

`RAIL_GUTTER` is 4px for a reason: combined with each row's own `RAIL_PAD_X` (8px) it lands the row
icons on the **12px column where the brand mark begins**, so every icon in the rail starts where the
logo starts. Labelled sections then add `RAIL_INDENT` on top. Collapsed keeps the same `px-1` on the
switcher and footer, which also holds the centered glyph column off the rail's right edge.
**Verify by measuring rendered rects against the aside, not by eye:** row icon-left ==
brand-glyph-left (12px), every fill gutter > 0, every rule span == `[0, rail width]`.

The desktop `<aside>` draws no border at all, so its `48px`/`272px` width is pure content — the
`--rail-w` offset contract below is exact with nothing to subtract.

## Scoped sections — data contracts

| Scope | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tasks | assistant-ui `ThreadListRoot`/`ThreadListItems` via `MewboRuntimeProvider` (rows off `threadIds`, NEVER `threadItems`) | `isDefaultVisibleOrigin` filter (user+channel) shared with `HomeView` via `utils/sessionOrigins.ts` so the two can't drift; cap 15 + "View all tasks" |
| Search | `useRecentSearchRuns()` → `GET /api/agentic_search/runs?limit=` (cross-workspace, newest-first; server clamps limit to 100) | row → `/search?ws=<>&run=<>`; hook degrades to empty list on error — no error residue in the rail |
| Wiki (gallery + pre-index flows) | `useWikiProjects()` | row → project via wiki `buildHref` ONLY (never hand-built paths; never assume a 'core' page id) |
| Wiki (INSIDE a wiki: `page`, `qa`, `graph`) | `useWikiPage(pageId, slug)` → the payload's own `nav` tree | rows navigate via `buildHref`; the page's own ToC is NOT here (see below); "All wikis" stays above so a reader is never stranded |
| Apps | `useApps()` filtered `status !== "archived"` | row → app detail |
| Settings | `useConfig()` → `SettingsModel.groups()`, filtered by the shell's visibility rule (`sections.length > 0 \|\| FACET_PANES[id]?.length`) | row → `?facet=<id>`; NOT a product — no switcher row, so nothing is `aria-current` in zone 2 |

### Settings facets — the three rules that keep the rail and the shell agreeing

Zone 3 on `/settings` renders the facet list, so the Settings page does not spend its own width on a
second nav column. Both surfaces write the same `?facet=` key.

- **Read the facet list from the model, never a copy.** `settings/facets.ts` owns the ids, titles,
  order and icon NAMES; the rail reads them through `SettingsModel.groups()`. A hand-kept list goes
  stale the moment a facet is added, and this repo has already paid for that class of bug once (a
  section whose `x-group` had no matching `FacetId` vanished silently into the fallback facet). The
  one thing the rail does copy is the `iconName` → lucide-component map, because `facets.ts` is
  deliberately React-free and the shell's map is private to it; an unmapped name degrades to
  `Settings2` rather than breaking the row. Exporting one shared map from `settings/` would remove
  even that.
- **Offer only the facets the shell considers VISIBLE** (has schema sections OR registered panes).
  The shell silently redirects an unknown or empty facet to the first visible one, so a row for an
  invisible facet would look like it did nothing. `SettingsModel.visibleGroups(paneCounts)` owns
  that predicate and the shell reads it; the rail still RE-DERIVES the same filter inline
  (`settingsSection.tsx`) and should adopt the shared method — one predicate, two callers.
- **Resolve "current" the way the shell resolves it, not from the param alone.** With no `?facet=`
  the shell lands on the first visible facet, so a rail reading only the param marks nothing current
  on the first paint of `/settings`. And a facet click must rebuild the query from `prev` and
  `.set()` only `facet` — the Automation pane is deep-linked as `?facet=automation&session=<id>`,
  and rebuilding the query from scratch drops the session.

**The shell treats `?facet=` as the source of truth, end to end.** `SettingsView` derives
`activeFacet` DIRECTLY from the param every render (`visibleGroups.some(g => g.id === facetParam) ?
facetParam : visibleGroups[0]?.id`) — no local state, no seed-once effect, and the shell no longer
writes the param at all (the rail is the sole facet nav). So a facet written by the rail or by any
deep link moves the URL, the rail highlight AND the rendered pane together.

### Wiki page tree — what belongs in the rail, and what deliberately does not

**The rail carries the PAGE TREE, never the table of contents — the distinction is the whole point.**
The rail is SITE navigation: "move to another page". A table of contents is INTRA-DOCUMENT
navigation and belongs beside the document it indexes, on the page's own right side. Swap them and
zone 3 becomes a second left rail full of headings while the way to another page sits elsewhere. If
a future change wants something in zone 3, ask which of the two kinds of navigation it is.

- **The entries are cached data, not a new query.** `nav` ships ON the page payload (the same tree
  for every page in a wiki), so the section calls the SAME `useWikiPage(pageId, slug)` query the page
  itself populated and TanStack dedupes it — no second request, no props, no context. Reach for a
  context only if a surface genuinely cannot be re-derived from cached data.
- ⚠️ **`nav` is only ever returned ATTACHED to a page fetch — there is no project-level page-tree
  endpoint.** So a route inside a wiki that doesn't name a page needs some page to key the fetch off.
  That is what `landingPageId` is for (validated to exist at finalize), and the fallback is free
  because `useWikiProjectBySlug` is a `select` over the same `["wiki","projects"]` query this section
  already reads. **Keep the fetch key separate from `activePageId`:** on the graph route the tree is
  fetched via the landing page, but the reader is not on it, so nothing is marked current.
- **Which routes get the tree, deliberately.** `page` and `qa` both name a page; `graph` names only a
  project and takes the fallback. The gallery and the pre-index flows (`welcome`, `indexing`) keep
  the project list — there is no page tree yet, and on the gallery the cross-project list genuinely
  IS the contents of the current context.
- **Section vs page is a STRUCTURAL test, not a positional one.** A row gets the folder glyph when
  some other entry names it as `parent`, and the page glyph otherwise. Keying off `lvl === 1` would
  brand every top-level leaf a section — a wiki's landing page and changelog are level 1 and have no
  children.
- **This is the one list that opts INTO leading icons.** Recents deliberately have none (the slot
  indents titles past the section header and breaks the one-column read). A page tree is
  heterogeneous, so the glyph carries a distinction a list of same-shaped recents does not have to
  make — which is why it goes through `RailRow`'s optional `leading` slot rather than becoming the
  default for every product.
- **Depth is indentation plus weight, never a smaller font.** `RailRow`'s `depth` prop steps levels 2
  and 3 in and gives only level 1 `font-medium`. Stepping level 3 down to `text-xs` bottoms out at
  an unreadable leaf and breaks the three-adjacent-steps rule. Long labels truncate — the width is
  fixed.
- **"All wikis" sits above both branches, with a rule beneath it.** A reader deep in a page must
  never need the browser's Back button to reach the rest of the product, and the divider keeps that
  escape hatch reading as its own zone rather than the first item of the list below it.

Tasks + Search recents share ONE date-bucket util (`utils/dateBuckets.ts`: Today / Previous 7 days /
Older, empty buckets dropped, `updatedAt || createdAt`, unparseable sorts Older). Don't fork it.

**The duplicate-list trap:** on `/` the landing IS the full task list, so the Tasks section collapses
to just "New task" there. Rendering recents on `/` doubles every title and breaks the App smoke
test.

## Design language (Aura-converged, web-translated)

Ported from the Aura drawer (`apps/mewbo_aura` — the reference implementation): flush-left compact
recents with NO leading icons; trailing 8px `--primary` liveness dot gated on `running` (the wire's
real signal — never a derived status), trailing so liveness can never reintroduce the indent;
full-row selection fill; hairline dividers between zones; pinned footer.

**Deliberate divergences from Aura** (translation, not drift): selection radius is `rounded-lg`
(8px), NOT Aura's stadium pill — `rounded-full` is reserved for state containers by the console
shape law; what transfers is the full-row fill + dedicated token. And desktop is a persistent
collapsible aside, not Aura's modal overlay — only the row anatomy, density, grouping and colour
layering port.

**Tokens:** `--rail-bg` (rail canvas — a distinct layer: paint the rail the page background and the
selection layering dies), `--rail-selected` (row fill) and `--rail-border` (every rule the rail
draws). All three defined in `:root` AND `.light`. The app body paints `--rail-bg`; the content area
floats as ONE rounded inset sheet (`rounded-lg` + hairline + `--background`, wrapper `p-2 md:pl-0`)
— the inset sheet IS the paradigm statement; don't flatten it.

## Type & density ramp

**One size for every word.** Every piece of READING text renders at `text-sm` (13px) — action rows,
recents, section headers, date subheaders, timestamps and supporting lines alike. Sizes still come
from the console's named scale (**never** an arbitrary `text-[<n>px]`, which the console-wide guard
test rejects); the rail simply spends ONE step of it. Hierarchy is carried by COLOUR, by INDENTATION
(`depth`) and by a three-level WEIGHT ramp — never by a size step, which at 1px reads as noise and
bottoms out at an unreadable leaf.

| Element | Height | Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Action / product rows (incl. the footer's account-menu row) | `h-8` | `text-sm` | `font-normal`, `font-medium` only when current |
| Recents | `h-7` | `text-sm` | `font-normal` |
| Section headers ("Recents", "Installed") | — | `text-sm` | `font-light` (300) — a non-interactive label, the LIGHTEST tier so it recedes below the rows it heads |
| Date subheaders, timestamps, supporting lines | — | `text-sm` | `font-light` subheaders; `font-normal` inline metadata |
| Numeric state pill (count pip · unread badge · version chip) — the SOLE exception | — | `text-2xs tabular-nums` | — |

**The colour ladder carries the hierarchy the size step used to.** The heading/label tiers
(`RailSectionHeader`, `RailDateGroup`, the instrument rail's `InstrumentSection` heading) recede onto
the dedicated per-theme `--rail-heading` token, calibrated to sit JUST ABOVE the 4.5:1 AA floor so it
recedes below `--muted-foreground` without dropping under AA — darker than muted in dark (5.33:1 on
`--rail-bg`), lighter than muted in light (4.67:1 on `--rail-bg`, its worst surface). Both directions
mean the same thing: recede. It is calibrated to that floor, not to taste, so do NOT "harmonize" it
back toward `--muted-foreground` — the gap IS the heading↔metadata hierarchy. Metadata rests on the
FULL `--muted-foreground`; identity and the current destination take `--foreground`.

**Metadata uses the FULL `--muted-foreground`, never an alpha of it.** `--muted-foreground/0.7` on
date subheaders and timestamps measures below the WCAG AA floor in both themes where the full token
passes — and colour is the ONLY rank channel metadata has left, so diluting it also erases the
distinction.

**EVERY icon and label begins on ONE base content column — 12px, where the brand mark begins — and
indentation only ever steps in AFTER it.** The 12px column (`RAIL_CONTENT_START`, a derived
`RAIL_GUTTER` 4px + `RAIL_PAD_X` 8px) is where the brand mark, the product icons, every action row's
icon, AND every header-tier label begin. A ROW reaches it via its zone's gutter plus its own padding;
the header/date-group tiers sit OUTSIDE the gutter wrapper (full-width, so their `border-t` stays
full-bleed), so they would otherwise begin at the bare 8px `RAIL_PAD_X` — LEFT of the rows they head.
`RAIL_CONTENT_START` is the fix: nothing starts left of 12px.

**Indentation is the third hierarchy channel, after colour and weight, and it FOLLOWS the base
column.** A LABELLED section's leaf ROWS step one `RAIL_INDENT` (`pl-1.5`, 6px — deliberately below
the 8px base inset, "visible but minor") further in, landing at **18px** = gutter 4 + pad 8 + indent
6. Its date-bucket LABELS do NOT indent — they are header-tier, so they stay on the 12px column with
the section header (a date bucket renders inside the `RAIL_INDENT` wrapper with its rows, so its
label alone counteracts that step with `-ml-1.5`, mirroring `RAIL_INDENT`; the two change together).
The rationale is accessibility: the indent makes a row's membership in its section legible at a
glance. Three rules keep it DRY: `RAIL_INDENT` is **defined once** (`rows.tsx`) and applied on **one
wrapper per rail** — the inner children wrapper `RailSection` nests inside its `RAIL_GUTTER` wrapper
— never per child; it applies **only under a heading**, so an unlabelled section (a lone action row,
the product switcher) takes the gutter but no indent; and `RailRow`'s `depth` composes its
`pl-4`/`pl-6` ON TOP of the indent for nested trees. The header is OUTSIDE both wrappers, so its
full-bleed `border-t` is untouched.

**Glyphs step down with their label.** Rows carry `size-4`; the two LABEL tiers
(`RailSectionHeader`, `RailDateGroup`) carry `size-3.5` and inherit the label's muted colour. A
header is a label, not a target. Pick a glyph that MEANS something (a clock for a date bucket, a repo
glyph for indexed projects); a decorative one costs the same space and teaches nothing.

**Header padding is `pb-2` / `pb-1.5`.** At `pb-1` a header collides with the first row under it and
reads as part of the list instead of introducing it.

**Weight is the primary hierarchy channel now that size is uniform, spent on a strict three-level
ramp.** `font-light` (300) is a NON-INTERACTIVE label — a section header, a date bucket, the
instrument-rail section heading — so it sits BELOW the rows rather than above them. `font-normal`
(400) is the resting state for every row and every piece of inline metadata. `font-medium` (500)
marks ONLY the current destination or an identity. `font-semibold` belongs to page headlines and
never appears in the rail. A heading at `font-medium` reads as heavier than — and so like a
clickable sibling of — the rows beneath it.

**Non-interactive labels carry NO hover or active styling**, which is what otherwise makes them read
as buttons. `RailSectionHeader` and `RailDateGroup` are plain `<div>`s. The one label
sitting ON an interactive control is the instrument rail's `InstrumentSection` heading (its whole row
is a collapse trigger): the LABEL takes no hover promotion; the affordance lives on the row tint +
rotating chevron.

⚠️ **`font-light` at 13px is legible ONLY on a colour that clears 4.5:1**, which is exactly why the
three label tiers ride `--rail-heading`. If 300 ever reads as frail, the fix is a DARKER token, never
dropping the rows' own weight distinction.

**Hit targets, not type size, set the density floor.** 32px and 28px both clear the 24px AA minimum,
which is what licenses the tighter rows; do not shrink either without re-checking that floor.

**The console-wide adjacency rule — at most three ADJACENT scale steps per surface — still stands
globally; the rail simply spends ONE step, which trivially satisfies it.** Do not read the rail's
single size as licence to loosen the global law. And the worked example is a POPOVER, not the rail:
the account MENU may keep its own three-step ramp (`text-sm` names · `text-xs` supporting lines ·
`text-2xs` chips) — do NOT "fix" it to one size, and do NOT cite it as the rail's pattern.

Icons: lucide only, `size-4` for rows and menu items / `size-5` brand, `gap-3` action rows / `gap-2`
elsewhere. `tabular-nums` on any live counter. ⚠️ **A size utility on a menu icon is inert** —
`DropdownMenuItem` styles its children through `[&>svg]:size-4`, a descendant selector outranking the
child's own `size-*` class, so a hand-written `size-3.5` there changes nothing and just misleads the
next reader. Match the item's own size or restyle the item.

## The two shared-definition traps

⚠️ **The recents row has a second CONSUMER outside this directory — it must IMPORT, never re-spell.**
Tasks recents have to be the assistant-ui thread-list primitive to get click-to-switch and the active
tint, so `assistant-ui/thread-list.tsx` builds its own element rather than rendering `RailRow`. That
makes it a hand-kept copy by construction, and nothing fails when a copy drifts — a row-height
change here lands silently out of sync there. So `rows.tsx` EXPORTS the vocabulary — `railRowCls` (geometry, spacing, resting type) and `FOCUS_RING` — and that file composes
them. **Adding a class to the row shell means editing `railRowCls`, not a consumer.** Two divergences
there are legitimate and should stay: colours split across Root/Trigger (the primitive's structure —
resolved values identical), and a flat `font-normal` for Tasks, which pass no `depth`. Colour is
deliberately excluded from `railRowCls` for that first reason.

⚠️ **The focus ring uses the UNDILUTED `--ring`, and this is not a style preference.** A `/50` on it
measured about 1.7:1, well under the 3:1 WCAG 2.4.11 asks of a focus indicator — the one affordance a
keyboard user cannot work around. It survived every automated check because the console's contrast
guard is scoped to `text-` position, so `ring-` is exempt by design; nothing will catch a
reintroduction. **If the ring ever reads too heavy at this density, spend ring WIDTH or offset.**
Thinning the colour is exactly what destroys the contrast. `FOCUS_RING` is the single definition
(`ui/focus-ring.ts`, re-exported through `rows.tsx` so rail consumers have one import); a consumer
keeping its own copy of the string is how one diluted spelling multiplies.

**Every zone label draws the rule above it.** `RailSectionHeader` carries `border-t` on
`--rail-border` by default, so the action row ("New task", "All wikis") is separated from the list it
introduces, in every product, from one place. It is self-limiting in the case that matters: Tasks on
`/` renders no header, so no orphan rule floats under a lone action row. `divider={false}` is for the
one section whose header OPENS the zone — Settings has no action row, so a rule there would double
the zone divider already above it. A per-section `border-b` instead puts the decision in four files
and drifts.

## State & responsiveness

- ONE persisted state: `mewbo:rail` = `"expanded" | "collapsed"` (desktop only). Legacy
  `mewbo:sidebar-open` is read once as a migration fallback, then only `mewbo:rail` is written.
- Mobile (`useIsMobile()`, 768px — the JS-hook strategy, not Tailwind breakpoints, for this
  decision): the rail becomes a `Sheet side="left"` rendering the SAME content 1:1, never persisted,
  default closed, auto-closing on every navigation. Entry points: a floating hamburger on landings
  (`variant="neutral"`, not ghost — a ghost button is invisible over varied content) and the
  `SessionHeader` hamburger, both via the `RailControls` context from `AppLayout`.
- Collapsed desktop = 48px icon rail (brand, product icons, bell, avatar; labels hidden;
  `Tooltip side="right"`). **One centerline — the collapsed column is a single vertical rhythm.**
  Every glyph below the brand sits in the SAME hit-target box: the kit's `railActionRowCls` +
  `justify-center px-0` (`h-8 w-full`, centered). The product switcher uses it via `RailActionRow`;
  the footer's bell and avatar COMPOSE the same box rather than hand-rolling their own. Glyphs are
  `size-4` — the collapsed avatar steps down from its expanded `size-6` so it matches the bell
  instead of dominating; the brand keeps its documented `size-5` on the same centerline. The unread
  badge is `absolute` over the bell's icon corner, so it never widens the flex item.
  `navRailCollapsedSymmetry.test.tsx` guards the box parity so a re-hand-rolled footer icon fails a
  test instead of shipping a crooked rail.

## `--rail-w` — the offset contract for viewport-fixed satellites

`AppLayout` sets `--rail-w` on its root: `0px` mobile / `48px` collapsed / `272px` expanded.
**Any `position: fixed` element that centers or anchors relative to the viewport must offset by
`var(--rail-w, 0px)`** — the fallback keeps it correct if the var is ever absent. Canonical consumer:

- `QADock`: `left-[calc((100vw+var(--rail-w,0px))/2)]` AND
  `w-[min(720px,calc(100vw-var(--rail-w,0px)-2rem))]` — **the width cap must shrink too**; shifting
  only the position pushes the right edge off-screen on narrow viewports with the rail expanded. This
  second-order bug is why both halves are law.

**Prefer escaping the rule over obeying it:** `TurnScroller` carried the `--rail-w` offset as a fixed
element, then dropped it entirely by re-anchoring `absolute` inside `.conv-scroll` (relative +
overflow-hidden, already spanning header-to-composer beside the rail) — containment and offset both
hold by construction, no viewport math. If a satellite can anchor inside a pane's positioning context
instead of the viewport, do that; `--rail-w` is for the elements that genuinely cannot.

## Z-index

The rail has NO explicit z-index on desktop — it is a normal-flow aside. Do not create one.
`SessionHeader` is `z-20` in-pane, below Radix portals. Adding any z-index to the rail must be
justified against the full stacking chain (console CLAUDE.md → "Z-index stacking contexts").

## Change discipline

- A new product row = a `products.ts` entry (component-free module: `PRODUCTS`, `Product`,
  `ActiveProduct`) + a section component honoring the self-contained contract + an `activeProduct`
  arm in `App.tsx`. Nothing else.
- **A scope is not automatically a product.** `ActiveProduct` is `Product | "settings" | null`:
  Settings scopes zone 3 without earning a switcher row, because the four-product switcher and the
  four-row avatar menu are both invariants and Settings is reached from that menu. Widening the union
  is how a route joins zone 3 without joining the switcher — prefer it to a fifth product row, and
  keep `PRODUCTS` the sole source of what the switcher renders.
- **A section whose deps live behind a lazy route loads lazily here too.** The rail mounts on every
  route, so the settings arm is a `React.lazy` split (`settingsSection.tsx`) with its own
  `<Suspense>`: importing `SettingsModel` and the pane registry eagerly would pull the whole Settings
  machinery into the bundle every route pays for.
- Rail row primitives (`rows.tsx`) are the ONLY row chrome — a product section that hand-rolls its
  row markup is a review reject.
- Preserve module-scope subcomponents (Radix open-state survives parent re-renders — still

  banner.
