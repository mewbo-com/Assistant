/**
 * Freshness + next-fire line for an app, read from the SAME system endpoint the
 * detail health strip uses (spec §2.6, DRY). Owns its own lazy query rather
 * than taking data as a prop — freshness is per-card and never worth blocking a
 * gallery render on.
 *
 * Renders nothing ONLY while there is no system data yet (loading / error) —
 * once the endpoint answers, it always says something. A live app with zero
 * runs and zero armed triggers falling through `!last_success_at &&
 * !next_fire_at` to a blank render would read as "fine", which is the exact
 * silent failure this guards against. "Never refreshed" and "No refresh
 * schedule" are explicit warning states, each independent so they can
 * co-occur. This is a deliberate departure from the wiki `FreshnessBadge`
 * stance of "stay silent until there's drift to report": an app that has never
 * run has no baseline to diff against, but "never ran" is itself the thing a
 * user needs to see, not a reason to say nothing.
 *
 * "Empty collections" is the poster-child case this whole component exists
 * for: a run can succeed (`stale=false`, "Last refreshed just now") while a
 * DECLARED collection a served page actually reads never gets a document —
 * every signal above stays green. `freshness.unwritten_collections` is the
 * server's answer; absent on an older server, so this chip is additive and
 * simply doesn't render when the field is missing or empty.
 *
 * The per-card burst on gallery mount mirrors the wiki freshness pattern and is
 * bounded server-side; do not add a bespoke client cache or request queue. If
 * galleries ever grow enough to matter, gate `enabled` on visibility.
 *
 * Layout: the chips WRAP rather than clip. The search `WorkspaceCard` meta
 * shelf is single-line-by-contract because its overflow is decorative source
 * avatars; every chip here is a warning, and a warning that has been clipped
 * out of the card is exactly the silence this component was built to end. Up to
 * three can co-occur, which does not fit one 260px grid track.
