# Mewbo Apps — Console Subsystem Guidance

Scope: `apps/mewbo_console/src/components/apps/` plus the colocated `src/api/apps.ts`,
`src/hooks/useApps.ts`, and the wire mirrors in `src/types/apps.ts`. The console surface of the Mewbo
Apps sub-product — a peer of Tasks/Wiki/Search, gated by the `apps` client capability. Read the
console root `CLAUDE.md` first; library-first, theming and shape-vocabulary rules apply unchanged.

## Surface shape — one ProductHero, one settings facet

- **Landing rides the shared `ProductHero`** (the peer of Tasks/Wiki/Search) — the `BrandMark` lives
  outside product dirs, don't re-import it here. `AppsLanding` composes the hero + intent composer +
  gallery grid; `AppCard` is the ONE gallery card and `AppStatusBadge` the ONE status pill
  (`rounded-full`, a state container; `broken` is the honest destructive tone).
- **`AppFreshness` always says something once `/system` answers** — it renders nothing only while the
  query has no data yet. The wiki `FreshnessBadge`'s "stay silent until there's drift" stance is
  wrong here: a live app with zero runs and zero armed triggers is exactly the degraded state a user
  needs to see, and silence reads as "fine". "Never refreshed" / "No refresh schedule" are explicit
  `--warning`-toned states, independent so they can co-occur; the optional `unscheduled_pipelines`
  field on `AppSystemHealth` names the gap when the server has it.
- **The gallery cells read as ONE geometry.** `AppCard` and the loading skeleton both render through
  `cardSurface({ radius: "panel", elevation: "elev-1" })` (`ui/card-surface.ts`); the dashed "create"
  tile deliberately does NOT route through it — it hand-rolls a `border-dashed` `<button>` but
  matches the card by re-stating the SAME `rounded-xl` + `APP_CARD_MIN_H` floor, so all three sit on
  one shape while only the empty tile's fill and border style say "this one is empty". Icons ride the
  shared `Button`'s `leadingIcon` prop, never a hand-margined icon child (a `mr-1.5` stacks on the
  button's own `gap-1.5` and doubles the gap). And an apps route renders NO `<main>` of its own —
  `AppLayout` owns the single `<main>` landmark on every route, so a nested one would be an invalid
  double landmark; the landing is a plain `<div>`.
- **The management pane is a Settings facet, not a page.** `AppsPane` (zero-prop, `React.lazy`,
  chrome-agnostic — the pane contract) registers on the `apps` facet in `settings/panes.ts`.
  ⚠️ **Facet + `x-group` lockstep still applies**: the `apps` `FacetId` in `facets.ts` and the pane
  registration move together, or the pane is a compile error / the section silently buckets into
  "Other". This is a pane-only facet (no backend schema section), so there is no `x-group` half to
  regenerate — but the `FacetId`/`FACETS`/`FACET_ICONS` trio is still one edit.

## Rendering — an app renders in an IFRAME; a chat widget renders in-document

**`AppFrame` is the app render surface, and the iframe is load-bearing, not styling.** An in-document
`@stlite/react` mount cannot work here: stlite runs Streamlit in the HOST document, and Streamlit's
multipage navigation calls `history.pushState(basePath + "/" + pageName)` on EVERY page switch.
wouter monkey-patches `history.pushState` globally to observe programmatic navigation, so it sees
those pushes, re-runs the console's `<Switch>` against a path `parseAppsRoute` cannot parse, and
unmounts the app the user is looking at — a sidebar page click bounces you to the Apps gallery.

- **There is no app-side fix, so don't look for one.** stlite's only pushState guard is `protocol ===
  "file:"`; `embed` mode doesn't suppress it; setting `basePath` only changes the prefix.
  `st.navigation`/`st.Page` doesn't avoid it either — both MPA flavors emit the same `Navigation`
  message through the same URL-writing path, and `position="hidden"` only hides the nav links. The
  one app-side avoidance is a genuinely single-page app switching views via
  `st.tabs`/`session_state`.
- **A frame owns its own `window.history`, `document.title` and style scope**, so the fix generalizes
  past that one symptom: the title guard and the style-scoping guard the in-document widget panel
  needs have nothing to defend against inside a frame. Treat host contamination as ONE class, not
  three patches.
- **Same-origin iframe = a CONTAMINATION boundary, NOT a security boundary.** `allow-same-origin` is
  mandatory (the injected SDK fetches `api_base` on the console's origin with no CORS headers;
  Pyodide fetches its runtime/wheels; its worker + WASM bootstrap are unavailable to opaque origins),
  and granting it beside `allow-scripts` means frame code can reach `parent.document`. What the
  sandbox DOES buy is the omission of `allow-top-navigation*`, which is exactly the host-hijacking
  class that motivated the frame. Don't market it as isolation from hostile app code — the
  render-token model owns that.
- **One render path for every embedder.** Aura renders apps by posting `mewbo-app-payload` into
  `widget-host.html`; the console frame consumes the same host page.
- **The chat widget card still mounts IN-DOCUMENT** (`StliteWidgetPanel`, portalled to `<body>`) and
  therefore still needs `useTitleGuard` + `useStliteStyleScope`. Do not delete those as "iframe made
  them redundant" — they defend the surface still in the host document.

### Two traps the frame introduces

- **The host page is at a DIFFERENT PATH in dev and prod, and both return 200.** Prod serves the
  separate relative-base build at `/widget-host/widget-host.html`; the dev server has no such build
  and serves the root HTML file at `/widget-host.html`. Request the prod path in dev and Vite's SPA
  fallback returns `index.html` — the console renders RECURSIVELY inside the app frame with no error
  anywhere. `AppFrame` branches on `import.meta.env.DEV`.
- **`/widget-host/` MUST be on the SW `navigateFallbackDenylist`** (`vite.config.ts`). An iframe load
  IS a navigation request, so without it workbox's `NavigationRoute` claims it and serves the
  precached `index.html` — the same recursive render, but only once a service worker is active, so it
  survives dev and a hard-reloaded first visit and appears on the SECOND load.
- **nginx needs no change for correctness, but does for caching.** `/widget-host/widget-host.html` is
  a real file, so the SPA `location /` `try_files` already serves it. Its assets under
  `/widget-host/assets/` do NOT match the `/assets/` prefix block though, so they inherited
  `no-cache` — and the console then loads that multi-megabyte stlite bundle on every app open. An
  `^~ /widget-host/assets/` block gives them the same immutable caching `/assets/` gets.

## The boot seam — generalize, don't fork

`src/widget/stliteBoot.ts` is SHARED with the chat-card widget renderer. It was generalized, not
copied: one private `kernelOptionsFor` that both `buildKernelOptions` (widget) and
`buildAppKernelOptions` (app) funnel through — `stliteBoot.test.ts` locks the output shape. That
shared funnel ALSO injects the platform theme (pinned `streamlit-facade` requirement, the wrapper
entrypoint, a seeded `.streamlit/config.toml`) into BOTH paths — see the console root CLAUDE.md
"Platform theming" for the traps before touching any of it.

- **The injected wrapper wears the AUTHORED entrypoint's path; the authored file is relocated to a
  private sibling.** Streamlit derives the multipage sidebar's MAIN-PAGE label from the entrypoint
  script's FILENAME, so a fixed wrapper name like `_mewbo_main.py` surfaces to users as "Mewbo Main"
  — a platform implementation detail in the app's own navigation. `relocatedEntrypoint` prefixes
  `_mewbo_app_` onto the original basename and keeps its DIRECTORY, because sibling-module imports
  resolve relative to it (a root-level private name breaks `pages/home.py`'s neighbours). The
  authored bytes are copied unmodified, so traceback line NUMBERS stay correct.
- **`basePath` is pinned explicitly.** Unset, stlite defaults it to `window.location.pathname` at
  kernel init, which is only right when the page IS the app. Inside the frame the pathname is the
  widget-host URL, so any surface whose hosting page isn't the app's own must pass it.
- **`buildAppKernelOptions` takes the multi-file `AppFrontend` map + entrypoint and INJECTS
  `_app_context.json`** (`{token, api_base, app_id}`) into the files. The injected context WINS over
  any same-named file in the app bundle — the app can't smuggle its own context. Same-origin serving:
  `api_base = API_BASE || window.location.origin`, so the render token + SDK talk to the same host
  with no CORS.
- **The SDK (`mewbo_app.py`) is injected server-side, not here.** The backend folds it into
  `frontend.files` at the detail seam, so the console bundles NEITHER the SDK nor
  `_app_context.json`-vs-SDK ordering logic — it only adds the runtime context. Don't re-add a
  client-side SDK copy.
- **Shared panel chrome lives in `src/components/stlitePanel.ts`** (`.ts`, NO JSX — theme/title guard
  hooks + `STLITE_STREAMLIT_OVERRIDES` + `PYODIDE_URL`). Consumed by `StliteWidgetPanel`
  (in-document, needs every guard) and, from `AppFrame`, only `useConsoleTheme` — the frame gets the
  Streamlit DOM overrides from the host page itself. Keep the module: the widget panel still depends
  on all of it.
- **The handshake is ready-signal driven and the `src` assignment is ordered.** The host posts
  `mewbo-widget-host-ready` exactly ONCE and silently drops a payload posted before it, so a missed
  signal hangs the app forever with no error. `AppFrame` therefore assigns `frame.src` inside the
  effect AFTER the message listener is attached — `src` in JSX starts loading during React's commit,
  i.e. before effects run, so a warm-cached host can fire ready into a window that isn't listening
  yet. Don't move `src` back into JSX and don't paper over it with a retry timer.
- **Re-posting the payload IS the theme update path.** The host tears down and remounts the kernel on
  a re-post, which is the only way to re-theme an init-only kernel. No second message type. The
  payload itself is held in a ref and read at post time, so a parent re-render (the caller builds
  `appContext` inline) can't reboot Pyodide by identity change alone.
- **Render token keyed by version + scope.** `useAppRenderToken(appId, version, enabled, writable)`
  mints via `POST /token`; `AppFrame` is keyed on `token_id` so a rollback / re-mint remounts the
  kernel (kernel options are init-only — a live kernel can't be re-themed or re-tokened, only
  remounted).
- **Write-back token.** `AppDetail` computes `writable = spec.pipelines.some(p => p.user_writable)`
  and passes it so the hook requests `scope:"write"` IFF the app declares a user-writable
  (form-input) pipeline — the ONLY case the served frontend's `app.pipelines.submit` needs. The
  server 403s a `write` mint for any app that doesn't (least privilege is structural, not
  client-trusted), and the console holds the master key server-proxied, which the `write` mint
  requires. `AppDetail` injects the minted token's `scope` into the `AppContext` so the injected SDK
  knows whether `submit` is allowed; a read-token page fails the write client-side, never a silent
  403.

## File map — `AppDetail.tsx` split on the `SectionId` seam

`AppDetail.tsx` is the root component only (status-branch renders + the rendered-app pane);
everything else lives under `railSections/`: `AppDetailHeader.tsx` (header + pause/resume),
`InstrumentRail.tsx` (the collapsible-cluster chrome — `InstrumentSection`/`CountPip`/`WarnPip`/the
collapsed icon strip), and one file per section body — `Health.tsx`, `Pipelines.tsx`, `Schedule.tsx`,
`Runs.tsx`, `Versions.tsx`. `flash.ts` holds the "flash, don't toast" timing
(`FLASH_SUCCESS_MS`/`FLASH_ERROR_MS`). `rows.tsx` is the instrument rail's ROW vocabulary
(`RailRow`/`RailList`/`RailMeta`/`RailNote`/`RailStat` + `RAIL_ROW_CLS`/`RAIL_TONE_CLS`, with
`RailEmpty` re-exported from the NavRail kit) — every section body renders rows through it. Add a new
section by adding a file here and wiring it into `InstrumentRail.tsx`'s `SECTION_META` + JSX — never
grow the root file again.

## Detail rail — a collapsible status-first instrument cluster

`AppDetail`'s right rail is an `InstrumentRail`: sections on the vendored shadcn `Collapsible`,
ordered by operational urgency — Health and Recent runs default OPEN (live state), Pipelines /
Schedule / Versions default collapsed (configuration/history). On lg+ the whole rail collapses to a
52px icon strip (one glyph per section, each re-expanding); persisted under `mewbo:apps-rail-open`.
Per-section open state is deliberately ephemeral — do not add per-section persistence.

**A warning is a state, not a count.** Health signals degradation with a `rounded-full` `--warning`
dot (state container), while runs/versions get the 4px count pip; the warn dot also rides the
collapsed strip's Health glyph so a degraded app stays visible with the rail closed (the
`AppFreshness` always-says-something law, extended to the collapsed state). The Pipelines section
renders only when the server reports liveness rows — on an older server the field's absence ≠ "no
pipelines", so hiding beats a false empty state.

Every rule the rail draws — each `InstrumentSection`'s top border, the cluster's closing bottom rule,
and the aside's lg left edge — rides the kit's `--rail-border` token, the same one the NavRail's zone
dividers use, so a boundary reads identically on both sides of the app. `--rail-border` already
embeds its alpha (`H S% L% / A`); never append another `/NN` or the browser drops the whole
declaration. A `--border`-family value at its inside-a-card alpha reads as no line at all against a
panel edge.

This is the border half of the shared-vocabulary boundary: the instrument rail takes the kit's
tokens, glyph sizes, `RAIL_PAD_X`, `RAIL_GUTTER`, `RAIL_INDENT` and `RailEmpty`, keeping only its own
collapsible section chrome (an axis the kit's static `RailSection` deliberately does not model) and
its own two-line instrument row — see `nav-rail/rows.tsx`'s module docstring. It composes the SAME
rules-vs-fills geometry as a labelled NavRail section: `InstrumentSection`'s body nests `RAIL_GUTTER`
(floats the row fills off the aside's left border) around `RAIL_INDENT` (steps the body in under its
heading), on separate wrappers so the 4px + 6px stack instead of colliding on `padding-left` — so the
row's FILL floats 10px in and its ICON lands at 18px (+ the row's own `RAIL_PAD_X` 8), matching the
nav side's labelled leaf row for row. The two rails read as one system.

## Build progress — reuse `useSessionEvents`, resolve on the real event

The creation flow tails the builder session's EXISTING `useSessionEvents` hook (`?session=` in the
route carries the builder session id) — NO bespoke transport, NO synthetic timer. That hook holds one
SSE connection open against `GET /api/sessions/{id}/stream` for the life of the view, so
`BuildProgress` renders each activity line as the server pushes it rather than sampling a poll. It
resolves on the real `app_ready` terminal event OR the detail's transient-status poll
(`draft`/`building` → 2s poll → flips to live), which stays the durable fallback for a build whose
`app_ready` event this view never saw (a remount, a dropped connection). The `app_ready` payload is
`{app_id, title, summary, version}`.

## `host.ts` — the `mewbo-app-payload` back-compat contract

`src/widget/host.ts` (the standalone `widget-host.html` embedder, chiefly the Aura WebView)
dispatches on the wire `type`, keeping BOTH shapes:

- `mewbo-widget-payload` (widget) — UNCHANGED, tested return shape stable.
- `mewbo-app-payload` (app) — `{entrypoint, files, requirements, app_context:{token, api_base,
  app_id}}`.

`parseAppMessage`/`parseHostMessage` validate defensively (a WebView shares one `message` bus) and
ignore anything else silently. Dispatch is on the wire `type`, NOT an invented `kind` — that's what
kept `parseWidgetMessage`'s tested return shape intact. Aura mirrors this exact shape; renaming a
field here is a cross-surface break.

## API client — `readJson` reads `data.message`

`src/api/apps.ts` re-derives its own `withBase`/`jsonHeaders`/`readJson` (mirroring the
`agenticSearch.ts` precedent — a small deliberate divergence from `httpBase`, not a third fetch
quartet to grow). Every request advertises `X-Mewbo-Capabilities: apps` so the create endpoint scopes
the builder session. **Its `readJson` reads the error body's top-level `message`**, which matches the
backend's `shape="message"` envelope exactly, so no envelope adapter is needed and a 4xx surfaces the
server's message verbatim. `mintAppToken` + `TriggerDTO` are the only trigger surface here
(`useAppRenderToken`/`AppSystemHealth`); the health strip reads triggers from `/system`, not from
granular trigger endpoints.

## Run-now + Re-arm — the on-demand refresh controls

`PipelineRow` carries a per-pipeline "Run now" (POST `/pipelines/<name>/fire`) and `HealthBody` a
"Re-arm schedules" action (POST `/rearm {seed:true}`, shown when `unscheduled_pipelines` is
non-empty).

- **Flash-don't-toast, and the flash must not be gated by the state it clears.** Put the success
  flash inside the `unscheduled.length > 0` block and it is unmountable exactly when it is earned: a
  successful seed empties `unscheduled_pipelines`, the `onSettled` invalidation refetches `/system`
  inside the 3s window, the gate flips, and only the ERROR flash survives — inverted feedback. The
  flash state + timer live in `HealthBody` (the mutation too; `RearmAction` is presentational) and
  the container renders on `(unscheduled || flash)`. **Generalize: any transient confirmation whose
  success MUTATES its own mount condition must hoist its state above that condition.**
- **Per-row mutation instances** (`useFirePipeline()` mounted inside each `PipelineRow`, args at
  `mutate()` time) give independent `isPending` per row; rows are keyed by pipeline `name`, so a
  `/system` refetch never remounts a row mid-flash.
- **Wire truths:** the code arm's `cache` is `"hit" | "miss"` (a Literal, NOT a boolean — both strings
  are truthy, the landmine class); the agentic 202 carries `status: "started" | "steered"` and NEVER
  `"refused"` (a refused wake is a backend 409 `{message}`); 429 additionally carries
  `retry_after_seconds` (`FirePipelineError.retryAfterSeconds`, appended to the flash as "retry in
  Ns").
- **202 means "data arrives later": ride the existing 30s `/system` poll** via the `appSystemKey`
  invalidation — no new poller, no run-completion subscription. The flash text distinguishes
  "Refreshed" (200 code) from "Refresh started" (202 agentic) because a 202 hasn't produced anything
  yet.

## Wire mirror discipline

`src/types/apps.ts` mirrors the Python contracts snake_case, frozen (three-way mirror: Python ↔ this
↔ Aura Kotlin). `AppDataDoc` is the ENVELOPE (`{app_id, collection, key, doc, updated_at}`) — the SDK
unwraps `row["doc"]`, the console's type is the whole envelope. Extend from the Python `models.py`,
never redefine a shape here. `AppVersion`'s additive `summary?: AppVersionSummary` / `verification?:
Record<string, AppVersionVerificationOutcome>` are the same discipline applied to version
transparency — both mirror `models.py` field-for-field and stay optional so a pre-existing version
row simply lacks them; every reader must tolerate absence rather than assume presence.

## Version transparency — diff summary + per-pipeline verification badges

The Versions rail renders what a submit/rollback actually changed, sourced entirely from the additive
wire fields above rather than re-deriving a diff client-side.

- **`versionSummary.ts`'s `describeVersionSummary` is the pure, React-free formatter** (same
  convention as `pipelineSchedule.ts`/`triggers/triggerFormat.ts`) — it composes a compact line
  ("2 files changed · +1 pipeline (meetings)") and returns `null` when every count is zero and every
  list empty, so the caller renders NOTHING rather than a fabricated "no changes" placeholder. The
  FE's line format is its own composition, not a wire value — the backend's
  `AppVersionSummary.describe()` string is never sent over the wire, only the structured
  counts/lists.
- **`VersionsBody` is exported from `railSections/Versions.tsx` for direct unit-render** (colocated
  `../versions.test.tsx`, the `agentic_search/RightRail.test.tsx` idiom) so a test need not mount the
  full detail screen. It renders the summary line under each version's note, plus one verification
  badge per pipeline (reusing the shared `Badge` — emerald/red/muted + ✓/✕/– glyphs, never colour
  alone) when that version's `verification` map is present. Reads are defensive throughout: a row
  carrying neither field must still render.

## Detail-screen freshness — `useApp` settled-state polling

`useApp` (`hooks/useApps.ts`) polls every 30s once the app is settled (past the transient 2s
draft/building poll) and refetches on window focus. Neither a repair, a rollback, nor an agent editing
its own app via `get_app`/`submit_app` pushes a signal to an already-open detail screen — the
`app_updated` event is emitted server-side but **not consumed anywhere**, an accepted v1 gap
(auto-refresh on repair is phase 2, documented on the API side too). This poll is the console-side
half of closing that gap.
