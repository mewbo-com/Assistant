/**
 * wikiStatus — the pure, React-free verdict a reader needs from the wiki
 * index-status card: "is this wiki current, and do I need to re-index?"
 *
 * `deriveWikiStatus` makes the judgment ONCE, from the existing data
 * contracts, rather than the card presenting raw drift numbers and leaving
 * the judgment to the reader, and hands back a single verdict the card
 * renders verdict-first.
 *
 * Five decision-relevant verdicts (the states the spec names), plus two honest
 * indeterminate ones that keep the card from ever showing a FALSE green:
 *
 *   indexing          — an index job is running for this slug right now
 *   failed            — the last index attempt stopped before it finished
 *   behind            — N commits behind the repo's remote HEAD
 *   update-available  — the remote moved but the commit count is unknown
 *   up-to-date        — the indexed snapshot matches the remote
 *   checking          — the freshness probe is still in flight
 *   unknown           — the remote couldn't be read; we decline to guess
 *
 * Precedence is operational, not alphabetical: a live job dominates a stale
 * count (you can't act on drift mid-index), a failed attempt dominates a clean
 * freshness read (the snapshot you're reading is the older good one), and only
 * then does the freshness comparison speak.
 *
 * `classifyFreshness` is the shared freshness→class kernel — it mirrors the
 * `FreshnessBadge` state table exactly so the badge and this card never drift
 * apart on what "behind" / "update" / "fresh" mean. The card layers the job
 * states and the honest-indeterminate refinements on top; the badge keeps its
 * own "stay silent until there's drift" stance and simply renders nothing for
 * the classes it doesn't show.
 *
 * Models never import I/O: freshness, the running job and the recoverable job
 * all arrive as plain data, so a test injects fixtures instead of mocking a
 * clock or a query.
