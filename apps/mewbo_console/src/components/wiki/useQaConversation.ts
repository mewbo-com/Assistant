/**
 * The Q&A conversation orchestration extracted out of `QAScreen.tsx`: the
 * live-stream / persisted-snapshot join, the "which turn is current" ternary
 * ladder, the idempotent-URL fold effect, and the per-conversation reset
 * effect. `QAScreen` is left with rendering `renderedTurns` — every stateful
 * decision about WHAT to render lives here so it can be unit-tested without
 * mounting the two-column layout.
 *
 * See `CLAUDE.md` → "Idempotent Q&A URL" and "Multi-turn follow-up" for the
 * non-obvious rules this hook encodes (why `publishedAnswerRef` exists, why
 * `settled` masks the stream's folded state, why a follow-up doesn't navigate).
