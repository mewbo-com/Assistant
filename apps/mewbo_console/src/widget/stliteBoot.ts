// Framework-free boot seam for stlite (Streamlit-in-WASM) widgets.
//
// This module is the single source of truth for how a `WidgetReadyPayload`
// becomes stlite kernel options. It is imported by BOTH surfaces:
//   - `StliteWidgetPanel.tsx` (the React console panel, via `useKernel`)
//   - `widget/host.ts` (the standalone `widget-host.html` page, via
//     `@stlite/browser`'s framework-free `mount()`)
//
// It MUST stay React-free (no hooks, no JSX) so the browser host can import it
// without pulling React into that bundle. The two differences between the
// surfaces — where the streamlit/stlite wheels come from (`wheelUrls`) and
// where the self-hosted Pyodide runtime lives (`pyodideUrl`) — are parameters,
// not hard-coded, precisely so this one function serves both.

 *
