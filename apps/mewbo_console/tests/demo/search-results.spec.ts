 * cards (e.g. `acme/runner-pool`), and the right rail (per-lane trace
 * summary + related questions).
 *
 * Deep-link contract (verified in recon): `/search?ws=...&run=...` on a
 * COMPLETED run fires exactly one `GET /api/agentic_search/runs/<id>`
 * snapshot + an SSE attach that replays the stored event log and closes —
 * never a `POST /runs`, never a live LLM call. No `page.route` stub is
 * needed for this reason; we instead wait for the terminal state (RunStats'
 * honest one-line status reads "... complete"), never a spinner.
