/**
 * Shot settingsPlugins (mewbo-console-05-plugins.png) — Settings › Plugins.
 *
 * This replaces a hand-capture that documented UI a user cannot reach: a
 * deleted top NavBar and the retired standalone `/plugins` page. Plugins is a
 * Settings facet now (`/plugins` redirects to `?facet=plugins`), so the shot
 * has to show the NavRail as the only primary navigation.
 *
 * Nothing here is fetched off the network. Both `GET /api/plugins` and
 * `/api/plugins/marketplace` are plain file reads against the fixture install
 * cache mounted at `/app/data/plugins`, and `plugins.marketplaces` stays empty
 * in the demo config, which is what suppresses the clone-on-read a configured
 * marketplace would trigger. So there is nothing to `page.route`-stub.
 *
 * ## Framing
 * The facet is ~1830px of content, so no landscape viewport holds all of it and
 * the shot has to pick a band. It picks the two panes — `Installed plugins` and
 * `Marketplace` — because that pair is what the docs pages promise
 * (`features-plugins.md`, and the index carousel's "Plugins and a marketplace
 * to extend any session"), and a Marketplace with no Install button in frame
 * would not show it. `pinToPaneTop` scrolls the facet heading out; the NavRail's
 * active `Plugins` row and the two card titles carry the identity instead.
 *
 * Pinning also makes the framing independent of everything ABOVE the pane,
 * which is worth more than it sounds: the sibling Projects shot tunes a raw
 * viewport height against absolute positions, so when the demo api stopped
 * serving a read-only config mount and the "Settings are read-only" alert
 * disappeared, every element moved up by the alert's height and that shot's
 * bottom edge had to be re-measured. This one did not move at all — only its
 * scroll offset did.
 *
 * 1400x1249 is chosen so the bottom edge lands in the GAP between marketplace
 * rows 2 and 3 rather than through one. It is taller than the sibling Settings
 * shots (1400x1000), which costs some window width on the 16:9 canvas and buys
 * the whole Installed list plus two Install buttons. Even so the composited
 * window comes out wider than the hand-capture it replaces, which was nearly
 * square.
 */
test.use({ viewport: { width: 1400, height: 1249 } });

/**
 * Breathing room left above the pinned card. At zero the card's top border sits
 * flush against the pane edge and reads as a clipped card.
