/**
 * Shot settingsSecurity (mewbo-settings-02-security.jpg) — Settings › Security
 * & Access: the configured-secrets roll-up plus the issued API keys.
 *
 * This replaces a legacy hand-capture that printed a live deployment's key ids
 * and labels (internal host naming + CI topology). Both rows here are seeded
 * (`console-poc.json` -> `api_keys`) with invented ids and labels, and their
 * stored hashes are salted so a seeded key can never authenticate anything.
 *
 * Determinism note: the issued-keys list is only byte-stable because the seeder
 * writes FIXED ids and T0-relative `created_at` values — `create_key` would
 * mint a fresh uuid and wall-clock stamp per seed. See
 * `DemoSeeder._seed_api_key` for why that is a written record, not a contract
 * call.
