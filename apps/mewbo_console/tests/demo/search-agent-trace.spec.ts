/**
 * Shot searchAgentTrace (04) — the Agent trace drawer (`TraceDrawer`, a
 * shadcn `Sheet` / Radix Dialog) opened over the run-oss-agents results
 * page, showing its 3 per-probe lanes (including the coordinator lane — the
 * root agent's own tool activity, `source_id === ""`, per
 * `components/agentic_search/CLAUDE.md` "Results-page top band"). Every
 * lane's `name` field is `scg-search` (the source the run fanned across);
 * `TraceDrawer.tsx:111` renders `agent.kind ?? agent.name`, and every seeded
 * lane HAS a `kind` (`coordinator` for this one, `scg-path-probe` for the
 * other two), so `scg-search` itself never appears anywhere in the UI —
 * don't anchor on it.
 *
 * Same GET-snapshot-only deep-link contract as `search-results.spec.ts` — no
 * `page.route` stub needed; we wait for the terminal state before opening
 * the drawer so the captured trace is the finished run, not a still-
 * streaming one.
