"""Post-run notice rendering shared by the TUI and the plain fallback.

Extracted from ``cli_master`` so both the Textual ``TurnEngine`` and the plain
non-interactive runner replay the same LLM-resilience / recovery / token-usage
notices without duplicating logic — and so the TUI never imports ``cli_master``
(which would create an import cycle: ``cli_master → app → turn_engine``).

Every function writes to a Rich ``Console``; the TUI passes a recording console
and forwards the captured renderable into the transcript, while the plain path
passes the real stdout console.
