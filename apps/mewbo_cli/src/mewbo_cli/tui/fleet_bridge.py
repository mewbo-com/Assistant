"""FleetBridge — refresh the faceted sidebar from live run events.

Integration glue (controller-owned, not a Wave-2 child): a per-run
:class:`~mewbo_core.hooks.HookManager` whose agent-lifecycle + tool hooks poke
the UI to re-pull the live fleet from the
:class:`~mewbo_cli.tui.agent_transcript_hub.AgentTranscriptHub`. The hub (a bus
observer) is the single source of fleet rollups AND the authoritative live todos
(the ``todos`` event); the bridge's only job here is to marshal a *refresh*
onto the UI thread (``app.call_from_thread``) whenever a run event lands, so the
:class:`~mewbo_cli.tui.widgets.fleet_panel.FleetPanel`, the plan dock and any open
drill view re-render promptly. (The panel also self-ticks while agents run, so
token/elapsed liveness never depends solely on a hook.)

The plan/todo dock is fed by the hub's authoritative ``todos`` event (an agent
calls ``update_todos``). These tool hooks only marshal a refresh — they never
re-project raw steps into progress the agent never reported.
