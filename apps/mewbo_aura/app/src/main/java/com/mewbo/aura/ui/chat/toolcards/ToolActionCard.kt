/**
 * The one base component every promoted tool renders through ([ToolCardRegistry] dispatches to a
 * bespoke renderer that composes THIS, or to the generic fallback that also composes this) - a
 * filled card that LIFTS the call out of the collapsed `ToolCallGroupCard` fold and gives it its
 * own surface.
 *
 * It does NOT suppress the turn's prose reply. The wire guarantees exactly one `assistant` event
 * per turn and the reducer never drops it, so a promoted turn renders `[card] → [prose]` - the card
 * ABOVE the narration (activity-precedes-narration, `data/CLAUDE.md`), never instead of it. The
 * reference app does suppress its prose; we deliberately do not, because a turn's narration is not
 * ours to delete - it may carry more than the tool's own result. Do not write copy here that assumes
 * the card is the whole answer. Anatomy is the reference's "action card" (GMS device capture):
 * a header that answers *which tool is this* (glyph + label), then a swappable content
 * slot carrying the tool's own payload. Every value is an Aura token; nothing here is measured off
 * the reference's pixels except the ANATOMY.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT interactive: no chevron, no expand, no click. The card is informational - the
 * fold (`ToolCallGroupCard`) remains the place to go digging at raw input/result JSON, and a
 * promoted call still needs no second affordance to say what it did. That is also why it takes no
 * `onClick`: adding one when no caller has a destination for it would be speculative.
 *
 * Not a member of the chip family (`PlanCard`/`AgentChipRow`/`ToolCallGroupCard`, all 36dp glance
 * rows): this is a payload surface with its own geometry ([AuraSpacing.ToolCard]). It shares only
 * their 24dp gutter inset, which it applies ITSELF - callers hand it a plain `fillMaxWidth`
 * modifier, exactly as they do for the chip family, and the alignment stays consistent across
 * every transcript row for free.
