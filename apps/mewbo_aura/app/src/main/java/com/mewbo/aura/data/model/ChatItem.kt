 * Renderable transcript item produced by [TranscriptReducer]. Every variant carries a stable

 * streaming updates recompose in place instead of re-animating a new item.
 *
 * `@Immutable` is a Compose *stability* contract, not a UI dependency - `androidx.compose.runtime`
 * has no Android/UI-toolkit code in it (unlike `androidx.compose.ui`/`material3`, which stay
 * forbidden here per data/CLAUDE.md). It's load-bearing: [TranscriptReducer] always hands back a
 * fresh instance per changed item (never mutates one in place - see `upsert`), but the compiler
 * can't infer that on its own because of the `List<ChatTodoItem>` field on [ChatItem.TodoList];
 * without this annotation every `ChatItem` is inferred unstable, which defeats Compose's
 * equals-based skip for every list row, not just the changed one (Task E review, fix round 1).
