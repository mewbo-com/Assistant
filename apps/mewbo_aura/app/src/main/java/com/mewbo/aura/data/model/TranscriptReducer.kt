/**
 * Pure, idempotent fold from the raw session event log into renderable [ChatItem]s. The SAME
 * event list always produces the SAME items - this is what makes SSE reconnect (full backlog
 * replay, api-contract.md section 3) and `/events?after=` backfill overlap safe: callers just
 * re-run [reduce] over the whole accumulated event list and duplicates collapse away.
 *
 * Contract invariants encoded here (see data/CLAUDE.md):
 *  - Content-key dedupe (`SessionEvent.toString()`, which already includes type+ts+payload)
 *    drops exact-repeat frames from backlog replay/backfill overlap.
 *  - `agent_message_delta` accumulates into one in-flight assistant item; `agent_message`
 *    REPLACES that buffer (drift reconciliation); `assistant` finalizes it.
 *  - Only root-agent narration (`depth == 0`) reaches the chat lane; sub-agent narration is
 *    dropped, matching "Transcript renders root-agent text only".
 *  - Optimistic local echo vs. the server's `user`/`user_steer` event is deduped by text +
 *    ts-window identity, not exact equality (their `ts` values differ).
 *  - `todos` is authoritative and replaces the whole checklist card in place on every event.
 *  - `completion`/`stream_end` close any open streaming state.
 *  - **Activity-precedes-narration**: within a turn, activity items (tool groups, agent chips,
 *    todo list) always precede the turn's assistant text item; a turn's text item is always its
 *    last item (error cards excepted - they always append at the very end). Real sessions
 *    interleave `tool_result`s with root narration deltas in either order within one turn
 *    (verified: 9/122 aura-android turns), so a tool group/chip/todo-list that first appears
 *    AFTER the turn's assistant-text item has already opened is inserted ahead of it instead of
 *    appended - see [appendOrInsertBeforeOpenAssistant].
