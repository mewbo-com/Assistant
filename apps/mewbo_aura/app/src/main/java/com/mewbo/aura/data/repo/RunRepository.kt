/**
 * The `shareIn` wrapping [RunRepository.live] applies to a session's raw upstream, plus the

 * its own top-level function (taking the raw upstream `Flow` + the cache + the dispatch directly,
 * rather than going through a real [SessionStreamClient]/OkHttp) so [RunRepository]'s own test suite
 * can drive it with a synthetic upstream instead of a real SSE connection.
 *
 * **Device-tool dispatch is a step in this PIPELINE ([onEach]), deliberately not a second
 * subscriber.** It sits UPSTREAM of the [shareIn], which is what buys all four of these at once:
 * dispatch sees every event regardless of who is subscribed when it arrives (a `replay = 0`
 * `SharedFlow` otherwise makes that a race); it needs no terminal-event detection, because it lives
 * and dies with the upstream itself, however that upstream ends; it can't pin the subscriber count
 * above zero and so can't keep an abandoned run's SSE reconnecting forever; and each session's flow
 * carries its own, so one session can never cancel another's dispatch. [DeviceToolDispatch]'s KDoc
 * has the full history - every one of those was a real defect in the design where the executor
 * subscribed to this flow instead. [DeviceToolDispatch.dispatch] must not suspend (it launches the
 * call on an app-lifetime scope and returns), or it would stall this pipeline and freeze chat
 * rendering mid-turn; a reconnect's full-backlog replay re-dispatches the same calls, which the
 * executor's own ledger makes idempotent.
 *
 * Two review findings (F1, F2) both trace back to the SAME root cause: [SessionStreamClient.stream]
 * is a COLD flow that COMPLETES once it sees `stream_end` (its own terminal-frame handling), but
 * `shareIn`'s `WhileSubscribed` only restarts collection on a subscriber-count transition back to 0.
 * Without eviction, a completed session's cached `SharedFlow` goes permanently dead and every LATER
 * turn in that same session silently receives nothing (frozen transcript, eternal spinner, device
 * calls never dispatched - F1). [onCompletion] evicts the cache entry the moment the underlying
 * upstream stops for ANY reason (`stream_end`, or `WhileSubscribed`'s own no-subscribers stop), so
 * the NEXT [RunRepository.live] call for this session id always builds a fresh upstream connection
 * instead of returning the dead one. (F1's original note claimed the count "never" reaches 0,
 * because the device-tool executor was then a permanent SECOND subscriber holding it up. It no
 * longer is - dispatch moved into the pipeline above - so the count really can reach 0, transiently,
 * mid-run. That is precisely what [LIVE_STREAM_STOP_TIMEOUT_MS] now covers; eviction-on-completion
 * remains necessary either way.)
 *
 * [catch] materializes an upstream exception into a [SessionEvent.StreamError] VALUE rather than
 * letting it propagate as a thrown exception: once a flow is `shareIn`-wrapped, an upstream throw
 * executes inside the sharing coroutine (on [scope], an app-wide `SupervisorJob` with no installed
 * exception handler) and would otherwise surface as an UNCAUGHT exception there - process kill on
 * Android (F2) - instead of ever reaching a collector's own try/catch, which only ever wraps its
 * OWN `collect` call, not `shareIn`'s internal one. `catch` doesn't touch `CancellationException`
 * (Flow's own contract), so a genuine `WhileSubscribed` stop is never mistaken for a failure.
