"""Phase-progress writer for map-source (SCG indexing) jobs.

A map job's progress lives in the *agentic_search* store (alongside search
runs), so it rides the same run-event-log + ``RunSseGenerator`` plumbing. This
module owns the single writer of the current phase — the SCG analogue of the
wiki's ``_ctx.emit_phase`` (which we deliberately do NOT import: the wiki helper
is bound to ``WikiJobCtx`` + the wiki store's ``append_job_event``/``update_job``;
the map job rides ``append_map_job_event``/``update_map_job`` instead).

``MapJobProgress.emit_phase(store, job_id, phase)`` dual-writes in one call:

* appends a ``{"type": "phase", "name": phase}`` event to the map-job event log
  (the live SSE projection the indexing UI tails), AND
* patches ``phase`` + ``phase_started_at`` on the :class:`MapJobRecord` snapshot
  (the durable read the landing card polls).

Both surfaces are derived from the same write, so they can never drift apart —
the invariant the wiki ``emit_phase`` upholds for indexing-page vs landing-card.
