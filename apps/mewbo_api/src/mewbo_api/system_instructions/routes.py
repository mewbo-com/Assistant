"""REST contract for custom system instructions.

An operator writes ONE Jinja template (stored as a singleton document, id
``"global"``) that branches on which client/surface invoked the session
(``mewbo_core.system_instructions.InstructionContext`` — surface, origin,
is_mobile, session_id, model, cwd, platform, hostname, mewbo_version,
capabilities, tools, project). This module is the REST CRUD + preview surface
over that document; the web console is the sole consumer.

**SECURITY — operator-only, REST + API key ONLY.** This document is rendered
straight into the SYSTEM PROMPT of every session. There is deliberately no
agent-facing SessionTool or MCP tool that can read or write it: an agent that
could rewrite its own system prompt is a privilege-escalation path. Every route
here requires ``X-API-KEY`` — do not add an unauthenticated or agent-reachable
path to this document.

Wire shape decisions:

* **The doc is a SINGLETON, not session-scoped.** ``GET`` never 404s — an
  operator who has never written one gets the same defaults
  ``SystemInstructionsDoc()`` would construct, so the console's editor always
  has something to render.
* **``PUT`` is a full upsert, not a partial PATCH** (mirrors
  ``CredentialUpsert`` — a thin transport shell, ``extra="forbid"``, so a
  client smuggling a server-owned field like ``updated_at``/``last_error``
  gets a clean 400). The server stamps ``updated_at`` and clears
  ``last_error`` on every successful write; a template that fails to COMPILE
  (``SystemInstructionsDoc.validate_template()``) is rejected 400 before
  anything is persisted.
* **``POST /preview`` never 500s on a bad template.** A render failure comes
  back 200 with ``{rendered: "", error: "..."}`` — this is what lets an author
  see a broken template BEFORE it reaches a live session, not a debugging
  surface that itself breaks on the input it exists to catch.
* **``GET /variables`` is GENERATED, never hand-authored** — so the variable
  table the console renders can never drift from what the renderer actually
  exposes to a template. Its SHAPE comes from core
  (``InstructionContext.describe(catalog)``, which owns the meaning of its own
  fields); its VALUES come from :class:`InstructionValueSources`
  (``value_sources.py``) — the app-side I/O edge that asks this deployment what
  tools/capabilities/projects/models it actually has. Each of those probes is
  best-effort, so the page an operator opens to FIX a broken template cannot
  itself be taken down by a dead LLM proxy.

Paradigm (mirrors ``triggers/routes.py`` / ``TriggerRoutesController``): this
module holds no mutable module-level wiring. :class:`SystemInstructionsRoutesController`
is the atomic class owning the injected store + auth guard as fields and every
serialize/validate/render/schema helper as a method; the Flask-RESTX Resources
are thin HTTP adapters that receive the one controller instance by DEPENDENCY
INJECTION via ``resource_class_kwargs`` (``init_system_instructions_routes``),
so the request path reads no module global.
