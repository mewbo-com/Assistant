"""The I/O EDGE of the instruction-variable value catalog.

``InstructionContext.describe()`` (core) is PURE — it turns an
:class:`~mewbo_core.system_instructions.InstructionValueCatalog` of plain
tuples into the documented variable table. Somebody still has to go and *ask
this deployment* what its tools, capabilities, projects and models actually
are. That somebody is :class:`InstructionValueSources`, and it is the ONLY
class in this feature that performs I/O — the controller stays a wire adapter,
core stays a pure renderer.

**Failure isolation is the whole design, not a nicety.** ``GET
/api/system-instructions/variables`` is precisely what an operator opens when
their template is misbehaving — often *because* something in the deployment is
broken. A dead LiteLLM proxy (``LLMConfig.list_models`` raises ``ValueError``)
or a hanging MCP server during registry discovery must therefore degrade that
one row to an empty value list, never 500 the page that exists to debug it. So
every probe is:

* **independent** — resolved on its own thread, so one source cannot take the
  others down with it (and total latency is the slowest probe, not their sum);
* **bounded** — a wall-clock deadline covers the case a plain ``try/except``
  cannot: a probe that never returns at all;
* **abandonable, exactly once** — see :class:`SourceProbe`: a probe runs on a
  DAEMON thread (an abandoned one never blocks interpreter shutdown) and a
  source has at most ONE probe in flight (a hanging source costs one thread for
  the process, not one per request);
* **logged once, then degraded to ``()``** — never re-raised into the request.

Collaborators are injected as FIELDS (the house paradigm): the config accessor,
the managed-project store, the tool-registry loader, the plugin fan-out loader
and the agent-file parser. Nothing is reached for internally, so a test
simulates "the proxy is down" by injecting a config whose ``list_models``
raises — no monkeypatching, and no network in the suite.
