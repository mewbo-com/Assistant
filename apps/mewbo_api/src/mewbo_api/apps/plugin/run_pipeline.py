"""The ``run_pipeline`` SessionTool — execute one CODE pipeline, on demand.

This is the "test your pipeline" phase made EXECUTABLE: a builder or maintainer
writes a ``pipelines/<name>.py`` file (``def run(params: dict, ctx) -> Any``),
then calls ``run_pipeline(pipeline=..., dry_run=True)`` to exercise it against
the real workspace-scoped ``ctx`` before ever wiring a schedule to it — schemas
enforce what prose instructs (spec), and this tool is that enforcement made
callable. It also serves the maintainer's own manual re-invocation of a
declared pipeline outside its schedule.

Unlike ``submit_app`` this tool is **terminal-free** (the ``app_data`` /
``update_todos`` shape): invoking a pipeline is normal iterative work, never a
run exit — a builder calls it, inspects ``docs_written``/``output``, fixes the
code, and calls it again, all within the same build turn.

Resolution mirrors ``app_data``'s three guarantees, adapted to a session with
no ``app_id`` argument (there is exactly one app per maintainer/builder
session, so the tool resolves it by SCOPE alone — the same query
``AppPipelineRunTracker._app_for_session`` already uses at the trigger-fire
seam): the app whose ``maintainer_session_id`` OR ``owner_session_id`` equals
this session, the named pipeline within it, a refusal for an ``agentic``
pipeline (it runs by being woken via its ``wake_prompt``, never invoked as a
tool), and — only then — the registered :class:`~mewbo_api.apps.plugin.runtime.PipelineRunner`.
An unwired runner degrades to a clean error, never a crash (mirrors
``submit_app``'s "apps runtime not configured" seam).

        ``outcome`` is exactly ``AppPipelineRunner.run_pipeline``'s return shape:
        ``{output, evaluated_at, docs_written, cache_hit}``. ``output`` is
        serialized to text and truncated to :data:`_MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS` with a note
        — a runaway pipeline result can't balloon the model's context. ``cache``
        folds the runner's per-call ``cache_hit`` together with the pipeline's
        declared ``cache_ttl_seconds`` (data this tool already has from the
        resolved spec — the runner doesn't need to report it back).

        ``run_key`` names the :class:`PipelineRun` row this invoke wrote, so the
        caller can read the run back directly instead of inferring whether its work
        landed from a manifest's ``last_run_status`` — which describes whatever ran
        LAST, frequently a run from long before this call. ``None`` means no row was
        written: a ``dry_run`` (no durable write to record) or a deployment with no
        ledger wired.

        ``run_key`` is added ONLY when the failed run was ledgered, so the model can
