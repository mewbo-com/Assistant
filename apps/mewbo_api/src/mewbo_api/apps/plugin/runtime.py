"""The apps plugin's collaborator contracts + the submitter wiring seam.

The two agent-facing session tools (:mod:`submit_app`, :mod:`app_data`) are
declared in ``.claude-plugin/plugin.json`` and BUILT through the ordinary
:class:`~mewbo_core.tooling.session_tools.SessionToolRegistry` plugin path, which feeds a
constructor only ``session_id`` + ``event_logger`` — so their real collaborators
have to be resolved some other way. Two resolution paths, matching how workstream
A exposes each collaborator:

* **The stores are process-wide singletons with factories** — ``app_data``
  resolves them directly via ``mewbo_api.apps.store``'s ``get_app_store`` /
  ``get_app_data_store`` / ``get_pipeline_run_store`` at handle time (A's
  docstrings name "the plugin" / "the ``app_data`` tool" as their consumers). No
  wiring seam is needed for those.
* **The lifecycle has no factory** (``AppLifecycle`` is constructed once in
  ``backend.py`` with the trigger store/policy + session backend), so
  ``submit_app`` resolves its submitter through the down-only
  :func:`register_app_submitter` push (mirrors ``register_builtin_root``): the API
  composition root pushes the concrete lifecycle at startup; the plugin never
  imports up to find it.

The collaborators are typed by **LOCAL Protocols** (not A's concrete classes) so
the plugin depends only on the method SHAPES the SDD ledger pinned, and a fake
satisfying the Protocol is all a test needs. Every signature here is verbatim
from ``.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`` ("Frozen cross-stream DI signatures"), with
the two additive optional kwargs A confirmed (``upsert(collection_spec=)``,
``query(sort=)``).
