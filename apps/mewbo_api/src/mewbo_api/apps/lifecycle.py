"""``AppLifecycle`` — the state machine that drives an app across its phases.

This is the ONE place an app is created, submitted-to-live, paused, resumed,
rolled back, or archived. Every status move goes through
:meth:`AppSpec.transition` (never a bare ``self.status =``), and every clock
read is the injected ``now_fn`` (never the wall clock in a behavioral path) —
the same discipline ``TriggerSpec``/``TriggerService`` follow.

Collaborators are DI'd FIELDS (atomic-class rule): the app-manifest store, the
trigger store + policy (triggers stay owned by the trigger subsystem — this only
arms/pauses them), a minimal :class:`AppSessionBackend` for the
session operations it needs, and ``now_fn``. Tests inject fakes + a fixed NOW;
nothing here imports a concrete ``SessionRuntime`` or reaches for a real clock.

The maintainer session is the app's durable agent home: created + tagged
``app:<app_id>`` at submit, advertising the ``apps`` capability so a trigger
that later re-engages it sees the maintainer/repair AgentDefs. Pipeline triggers
are **armed on it** at submit from each pipeline's DECLARED ``schedule``: the
builder declares a ``time.cron``/``time.at`` schedule in its
manifest and the PLATFORM mints the trigger on the maintainer, stamping the id
into the (platform-owned) ``trigger_ref``. The builder does not self-arm on this
path. The secondary flow — the builder hand-arms a trigger on its own ephemeral
session and submit re-homes it — is still honoured for a chat-builder (see
``_rehome_pipeline_trigger``), but declared schedules are the primary path. See

        compared them: a key the catalog does not know (an app id, a title, a
        directory name) persisted happily and then failed on EVERY turn of the
        maintainer session, which resolves the same field through the catalog.
        The submit boundary is where model-authored data crosses into storage,
        so it is where the two namespaces are made to agree.

        **A method here, NOT a ``model_validator`` on ``WorkspaceRef``** — the
        ``ensure_unique_pipeline_names`` precedent, and the reason is
        load-bearing: the app store is append-only, so stored ``AppVersion``
        snapshots already holding a bad key MUST keep parsing, or every detail
        read of an affected app 500s. Validation of NEW data belongs at the
        trust boundary it crosses; stored history re-crosses the parse seam
        under the contract it was written with.

        **``resolve`` rather than ``find``**, because ``resolve`` is what the
        key eventually reaches. ``find`` would accept a key that is listed but
        has no usable directory (a registered repository with no checkout), so
        submit-time acceptance would stop meaning run-time resolvability — the
        same silent wedge in a narrower form. Its refusal message already embeds
        the catalog's own available-list, so the reask is correctable in one turn
        without reaching into the private ``_available_hint``.

        **But the runtime is not ``resolve`` — it is
        ``backend.py:_resolve_project_cwd``, which RECOVERS from one refusal**:
        an ``unavailable`` MANAGED project (or worktree) is a directory Mewbo
        owns, so the runtime creates it and succeeds. Refusing that here would
        make submit STRICTER than the thing it predicts, which is the opposite
        of the property this check exists for, and would block a builder binding
        to a perfectly good managed workspace. So that one arm is mirrored:
        ``unavailable`` + a managed/worktree entry with a path ⇒ accept. Every
        other code — ``not_found``, ``no_checkout``, ``auto_sentinel``,
        ``empty``, and ``unavailable`` on a CONFIGURED project, whose directory
        belongs to the operator — still refuses.

        **That mirroring is a SECOND COPY of a rule, and that is a cost, not a
        win.** ``backend.py:_resolve_project_cwd`` is the authority; this copy
        will drift the day that recovery changes. The real cure is for the
        recovery to live on :class:`ProjectCatalog` so both callers read one
        implementation — worth doing, deliberately not done here.

        **No side effects.** Unlike the runtime, this makes no directory: a
        validator that mutates the filesystem is the wrong shape. Only the
        accept/refuse DECISION is mirrored, never the repair.

        ended, or one reached only via REST/an operator, previously had NO way to
        open a conversation with its own maintainer. This is that route back.

        Resolution mirrors ``get_app``/``submit_app``'s ``_resolve_app`` scan
        (maintainer, then owner) so the session handed back is one that scan can
        already find: minting a THIRD session here would give the app two live
        claimants and make the scan's first-match order load-bearing. A builder
        session that never submitted (``owner_session_id`` set,
        ``maintainer_session_id`` still ``None``) is therefore REUSED, never
        replaced — the draft-in-progress case.

        **Decision: an ``archived`` app is NOT refused.** `submit`'s
        maintainer-resubmit branch overwrites ``status`` to ``"building"`` in
        memory before calling ``AppSpec.transition("live", ...)``, bypassing

        — the documented way an app's own maintainer revives an archived app (see
        :meth:`submit`'s docstring). Refusing this route for an archived app would
        strand the one session that can ever reach that revival path again, for
        no corresponding safety gain — archiving already cancelled every trigger
        the app owned, so a reachable maintainer session grants no more than an
        agent conversation, not a live re-arm.

        A session that was PERMANENTLY TERMINATED is never handed back (a
        terminated session is a documented dead end — it cannot be steered or
        re-engaged) — that case mints a replacement instead.

        **``fresh=True`` skips the reuse entirely and always mints**, for a caller
        that asked to START a conversation about this app rather than be handed
        the one already in progress — a composer submitting a turn, as against
        the "open session" action on the app detail header, which wants exactly
        the reuse above and is why that stays the default.

        A fresh session is deliberately NOT written back to
        ``maintainer_session_id``: the repair wake dereferences that field, and a
        second claimant would make the resolvers' first-match scan order decide
        which session keeps working. It is bound by its TAG instead, and it is
        therefore READ-plus-STAGE only — see :meth:`AppStagingArea.app_for_session`

        ``tracker.pipeline_runner`` — no new DI), so a pipeline that can't lint,
        import, or run refuses the submit HERE (an actionable ``ValueError`` → the
        builder's reask) instead of going live and failing on its first fire.
        ``dry_run=True`` guarantees NO durable write, and calling ``execute`` directly
        (never the tracker's ``record_code_run``) guarantees NO ledger row — the
        verify must leave no trace.

        A code pipeline's dry run executes the REAL runner path — including a real,
        budget-bounded ``ctx.llm`` call if the pipeline declares one. Only AGENTIC
        pipelines make no model call, and only because they are skipped (below) — the
        verifier is not model-call-free in general.

        Per-pipeline verdicts land on the version row (``AppVersion.verification``):

        * ``mode="agentic"`` ⇒ ``"skipped"`` — an agentic wake is judgment, not a
          smoke-testable transform, so it is not run (a documented honest gap).
        * runner unwired ⇒ ``"skipped"`` + one loud log — never a crash
          (unwired-tolerant, mirroring the seed/fire seams).
        * a dry run that fails on ``params`` or ``workspace`` ⇒ ``"skipped"`` — both
          are verifier ARTIFACTS at submit time, not pipeline defects (a
          ``params_schema`` requiring params a ``params={}`` smoke can't supply, e.g.
          a ``user_writable`` form; and ``ctx.read_file`` on the not-yet-bound
          workspace). See the except below.
        * otherwise ``"pass"`` on a clean dry run; a genuine failure (lint / import /
          runtime / traversal / …) never reaches a persisted ``"fail"`` because it
          refuses the submit first.

        **The disarm trap:** this dry run can only classify a ``PipelineExecutionError``
        that actually propagates out of ``execute()`` — it does no static analysis of
        the pipeline body. A pipeline whose own code catches and swallows
        ``PipelineExecutionError`` (e.g. a broad ``except`` around ``ctx.read_file``)
        makes BOTH the genuine-failure refusal above AND the ``params``/``workspace``
        skip-classification unreachable: the swallowed error never reaches this method,
        so the dry run returns normally and the pipeline verifies ``"pass"`` regardless
        of what actually broke.

        that SUCCEEDED while regressing a collection earlier runs wrote
        (:class:`PipelineIssue` carries which, and owns the prose for each). Three
        declarative reactions wired onto EXISTING seams (no new hook engine):
        ``repair`` starts a repair run on the maintainer via the same
        run-starter that kicks off the builder; ``pause`` pauses the app + its
        triggers; ``notify`` emits an ``app_issue`` event and does nothing else.

        The policy is honoured IDENTICALLY for both kinds — an operator who
        declared ``pause`` for a broken pipeline gets a pause for a pipeline that
        silently stopped writing, because that is the same declaration and
        second-guessing it here would make the policy mean two things. The ONE
        addition is the event: an issue that leaves no other user-visible trace
        emits ``app_issue`` on top of whatever the policy did (see
        :attr:`PipelineIssue.needs_own_event`), so ``repair``/``pause`` can never
        act on something the user was never told about.

        the tracker rides.
