"""Flask-RESTX namespace for the Mewbo Apps REST surface.

Wire shapes match the ALREADY-COMMITTED clients verbatim (console
``src/api/apps.ts`` + ``src/types.ts``, Aura, and the injected SDK
``plugin/sdk/mewbo_app.py``) — the clients are the consumers, so the API
conforms to them.

Endpoints under ``/api/apps``:

Gallery + CRUD (master/issued-key auth)::

    GET    /apps                     gallery (lean AppSummary cards)
    POST   /apps                     create a draft app -> {app_id, session_id}
    GET    /apps/<id>                {spec, versions}  (AppDetail)
    PATCH  /apps/<id>                edit title/summary/icon -> AppDetail
    POST   /apps/<id>/archive        archive -> AppSpec  (no hard delete)

Read-only introspection (master key OR app-scoped read token)::

    GET    /apps/<id>/data/<collection>   AppDataDoc envelopes (filter/sort/limit)
    GET    /apps/<id>/system              consolidated AppSystemHealth (§2.6)
    GET    /apps/<id>/pipelines           declared pipeline surface

Pipeline invocation (``mode="code"`` only)::

    GET    /apps/<id>/pipelines/<name>    invoke, read-auth, params from the query string
    POST   /apps/<id>/pipelines/<name>    invoke, WRITE-auth, params from the JSON body

Management (master/issued key only)::

    POST   /apps/<id>/token          mint a read (or, master-key-only, write) token
    GET    /apps/<id>/triggers       app-scoped triggers (TriggerDTO[])
    POST   /apps/<id>/pause          pause the app + its triggers -> AppSpec
    POST   /apps/<id>/resume         resume the app + its triggers -> AppSpec
    POST   /apps/<id>/rollback       repoint to an earlier version -> AppDetail

Auth model. The data + system GETs and the pipeline-list/invoke-GET accept a
master/issued key OR a short-lived app-scoped token (any scope); the token is
its own ``token_id`` (the whole signed blob) presented in the
``X-Mewbo-App-Token`` header (the SDK's contract). A token whose ``app_id``
differs from the path is 403 (no cross-app read). The invoke-POST additionally
requires a ``write``-scoped token (or the master/issued key) — a valid
``read`` token there is 403, never silently accepted. The data plane is
READ-ONLY at the REST layer — no write verb exists, so a write attempt 405s.
A ``mode="agentic"`` pipeline (the default) is never synchronously invocable —
GET/POST on it 409s; it runs only on its own schedule or via its maintainer.

Error bodies carry a top-level ``message`` (the ``message`` wire-shape
``ApiResponseKit`` documents as ``shape="message"``, which the console's
``readJson`` surfaces as ``data.message``) — matching the ``agentic_search``
routes. ``ApiResponseKit`` exposes no generic runtime error builder (only the
410 ``terminated_response()``), so the shape is produced directly and documented
via the kit's ``shape="message"`` decorators.

Paradigm: the ``triggers/routes.py`` DI idiom — :class:`AppsRoutesController`
owns the collaborators + every domain method; thin Resources receive it via
``resource_class_kwargs`` and pass request data as ARGUMENTS (the controller
never reads ``flask.request``, so it unit-tests with plain dicts + a fixed NOW).
