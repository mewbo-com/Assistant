"""Short-lived, render-scoped read/write tokens for a served app.

Spec §2.7 / §7; the write scope covers pipeline invocation.

When the console/Aura opens an app, the platform mints a token carrying ONLY
the ``app_id`` and a scope, with a near-term expiry. The served frontend's
injected SDK presents it on the read-only data/system endpoints (and, with a
``write``-scoped token, the pipeline-invoke POST); the master key never enters
the browser/WebView.

The token is **stateless** — it needs no token store. It is an HMAC-SHA256 tag
(stdlib ``hmac``, no new dependency) over ``app_id:expiry:scope:token_id`` (see
below) keyed by a server secret, so the API can verify it by recomputing the
tag and comparing in constant time. Validity (expiry) is decided by
:meth:`AppReadToken.is_valid` on the model — the clock always arrives as a
method argument, per the strategy-on-model rule this package follows (see
``models.py``).

``AppReadTokenSigner`` is the one atomic home: the secret + default TTL are its
injected state; :meth:`mint` and :meth:`verify` are its behavior. Wire it with
the deployment's server secret (the API master token) at startup.

The token's ``token_id`` field IS the presented bearer credential (the cross-stream
contract the console/Aura/SDK landed against): the whole signed blob lives in
``token_id``, the client sends it back verbatim in the ``X-Mewbo-App-Token``
header, and :meth:`verify` re-derives ``app_id`` + expiry (+ scope) from it. So
there is no separate opaque token string — ``AppReadToken`` is fully
self-describing on the wire.

**Wire format (additive, backward compatible).** A freshly
minted token is always 5 colon-separated parts:
``<app_id>:<exp_epoch>:<scope>:<nonce>:<sig>``. A 4-part blob with no ``scope``
segment (``<app_id>:<exp_epoch>:<nonce>:<sig>``) is also accepted and treated as
``scope="read"``, so an outstanding token survives a mid-flight deploy without a
hard cutover. Both shapes stay unambiguous under
a plain ``split(":")`` because ``app_id`` is a colon-free slug, ``scope`` is
one of the fixed literals, and ``nonce``/``sig`` are colon-free (hex / urlsafe
base64).
