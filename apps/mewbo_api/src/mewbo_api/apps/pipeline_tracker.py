"""The :class:`PipelineRun` ledger seam — open at trigger fire, close at run end.

Opens the ledger when a fired trigger re-engages an app maintainer and closes it
at the maintainer run's end.

The ledger is the app sub-product's provenance chain, freshness signal,
``/system`` backing, and repair-loop input all at once — but it only becomes
LIVE once something OPENS a run when a pipeline fires and CLOSES it when the
maintainer run ends. This atomic class is that seam, wired at the two existing
seams ``backend.py`` already owns:

* **Open** — the trigger-deliver path (``_trigger_deliver``). A fired trigger
  re-engaging a maintainer session resolves to the pipeline whose
  ``PipelineSpec.trigger_ref`` matches the firing ``trigger_id`` and opens a
  ``running`` :class:`PipelineRun`. The ``app_data`` write hook then increments
  its ``docs_written`` (workstream B), so freshness/provenance/system counts go
  live the moment this lands.
* **Close** — the ``HookManager.on_session_end`` hook (chosen over the
  deliver-closure completion path because ``start_async`` returns a ``run_id``
  IMMEDIATELY and never observes run completion; the session-end hook fires when
  the run actually ends, carrying its ``error`` — the outcome we classify on).

On a ``failed`` close it hands the app + error to the lifecycle's
``handle_pipeline_failure`` (policy dispatch — repair/pause/notify).

Collaborators are DI'd FIELDS (atomic-class rule): the run + app stores, a
``failure_handler`` (the lifecycle), and ``now_fn``. NOW is always a method arg
downstream (``PipelineRun.open``/``close``); nothing here reads the wall clock in
a behavioral path. Tests inject fakes + a fixed NOW.

        * the **scheduled fire seam** (``kind="scheduled"``, ``dispatch_failure=True``)

          failure DISPATCHES the ``on_pipeline_failure`` policy (an autonomous

        * the **on-request REST invoke endpoint** (``kind="on_request"``,
          ``dispatch_failure=False``, ``require_effect=True``) — reads
          ``result.output`` for its response, and a failure does NOT auto-repair/pause:
          a user manually invoking a pipeline that errors should surface the error, not
          flip the app to ``paused``/spawn a repair run. The endpoint maps the failure
          to its HTTP status from ``run.error`` (``result is None`` ⇒ it failed).

        It NEVER raises — a runner failure closes the row ``failed`` (with the error)
        and returns ``(failed_run, None)``, so a caller reads the outcome off the row
        rather than catching. The persisted row carries ``docs_written`` + ``cache``
        hit/miss + ``params_hash``; ``result`` is the (frozen) success payload or
        ``None`` on failure.

        *require_effect* (default ``False`` — the scheduled-fire behavior is
        UNCHANGED) gates whether a SUCCESSFUL run is durably persisted: when
        ``True``, only a run that had a real effect (``cache="miss"`` AND a
        non-empty ``docs_written``) is saved to the ledger — the anti-spam
        ruling for the on-request REST invoke path, where a cache hit or a
        read-only render must never mint a row (a polling client on a
        ``cache_ttl_seconds=0`` pipeline would otherwise spam the ledger on every
        request). A FAILURE is ALWAYS persisted regardless of this flag — a
        genuine break is real provenance no matter how the pipeline was invoked.
        The run object is still RETURNED either way; only the durable write is
