"""Durable purpose-binding for a session — the spec every re-engage path reads.

What a session is FOR — which surface created it, against which project/cwd, on
what model ladder, under which tool ceiling and capabilities — is first-class
session state, not a set of untyped ``context``-event keys each re-engage site
re-reads by hand. A site that re-derives one of them from config instead (and
then PERSISTS that default) lands a console follow-up on a different model, with
a different tool set, no playbook, and a cwd pointing at an empty per-session
temp dir.

:class:`SessionSpec` is that state, persisted rather than passed as bare
``start_async`` kwargs. The spec is
written INTO an ordinary ``context`` event that carries BOTH the loose
keys every existing reader consumes (``model``/``mcp_tools``/
``strict_tool_scope``/``skill_instructions``/…) AND a typed ``session_spec``
mirror. Writing the full payload is load-bearing, not tidiness: a context reader
takes the most-recent event's payload VERBATIM, so an event carrying only the
typed blob would blank every loose field for ``/message``, ``/recover`` and the
trigger wake.

The model owns the one decision that matters — :meth:`SessionSpec.merge_request_overrides`,
which field a request may legitimately override. A user changing the model is
legitimate; a surface silently swapping the tool set out from under a
purpose-bound session is not. The ``editable`` projection a front end trusts is
derived from that SAME predicate, so the two can never drift.

        ``/query``, ``/message``, ``/recover`` and unattended trigger fire loads the
        binding first — so it asks for the ONE context event it needs rather than a
        transcript. Measured on the deployed store's largest session: 10,296 documents /
        14.5 MB against 1 document / 0.2 KB, with ``explain`` reporting
        ``docsExamined 1`` off the existing ``ix_events_type_session_ts``.

        Two reads, and the second only fires when the first misses: the newest context
        event CARRYING the mirror, then the newest context event at all. The narrowing is
        by TYPE, never by a count — the newest context event sits arbitrarily far back
        after a long run, and a window that misses it would report "no binding", which
        un-binds a purpose-bound session and re-opens the whole
        ``OVERRIDABLE_WHEN_UNBOUND`` tier. That is a wrong ANSWER, not a slow one.

        The fallback deliberately reads ONE payload rather than merging every context
        event: merging would resurrect a field the user cleared (a removed project
        sticking forever), the same reason the generic context reader never merges
        either.

        The typed mirror's ``origin`` is RE-CLASSIFIED here too, through the same
        :meth:`origin_for` the reconstruction legs use, rather than trusted verbatim
        off the blob. ``SessionOrigin`` is derived, never stored — a blob's ``origin``
        field is only ever a value some earlier classifier stamped at write time, and
        trusting it verbatim would freeze a session under a stale classification the
        NEXT classifier fix corrects for every session reconstructing from context but
        not for this one. Every other field on the mirror stays authoritative; only
        this one field is re-derived on every read, like the rest of the binding.

        A value under ``SPEC_CONTEXT_KEY`` that is present but NOT a dict reconstructs

        :meth:`SessionSpec.to_context_payload` always stores a dict — but the narrowing
        the store applies is "the key is SET", deliberately coarser than "the key holds
