# itself at clone time via the canonical chain
# (``mewbo_graph.wiki.credentials.resolve_chain`` — arg → repo-scoped store →
# host-scoped store → ambient git credential → anonymous), so this module only
# ever needs to WRITE the durable credential, never stash/restore it.

# Tools the wiki-indexer agent is allowed to call. Mirrors the AgentDef's
# frontmatter `tools:` list (wiki-indexer.md); these MUST stay in sync.
# NOTE: wiki_build_graph / wiki_query_graph are Phase-3 tools — tolerated
# when absent at runtime (the tool registry silently skips unknown names).
#
# No `glob`/`grep`/`ls` entry belongs here: no `ToolSpec`/`SessionTool` is
# ever registered under those lowercase ids (`CC_TOOL_MAP` only maps the
# CAPITALIZED `Glob`/`Grep`/`LS` Claude Code names onto real aider tool ids),
# so a bare lowercase name silently resolves to nothing — `filter_specs` and
# `SessionToolRegistry.ids_for` both drop an unknown id rather than erroring.
# The indexer's read surface is `read_file` (core) plus the manifest
# `wiki_scan_tree` already produced; don't re-add these as a "missing search
# tool" fix.
#
# `resolve_entity` (product decision): the playbook body (Step 5, "Construct
# PagePlan") instructs the root to make the plan entity-aware by consulting
# the entity graph via `resolve_entity` — documented, intended design (see
# packages/mewbo_graph/CLAUDE.md's GraphRAG ordering law), not incidental
# prose, and `tests/wiki/test_agent_defs.py::
# test_indexer_carries_entity_tools_and_enrich_step` already asserts it. Under
# `strict_tool_scope=True` (see `_start_indexer_session`) the allowlist is
# what decides what the root can call, so leaving this out would make the
# playbook instruct a call the ceiling forbids. It is a read-only lookup, so
# granting it widens nothing meaningfully. `mint_entity` / `relate_entities`
# stay OUT — those are WRITES the `wiki-enricher` child performs; a parent
# does not need a tool itself in order to grant it to a child (a child's
# specs are filtered against its OWN allowlist, never the parent's).

#
# The core `read_file` is OUT, and `wiki_read_file`/`wiki_grep`/`wiki_list_files`
# are in its place. Those resolve the checkout SERVER-SIDE from the store (and
# are traversal-guarded and byte-capped besides), so this session needs no
# repository `cwd` at all — which is what keeps it clear of the `<cwd>/.mcp.json`
# tier that an indexed repository could otherwise use to name processes for the

# Tools the on-demand MAINTAINER session may call. Deliberately the same
# ceiling as the act pass, because the two need exactly the same capability:
# read this project's pages, graph and checkout, and rewrite a page in place.
# Aliased rather than re-listed so the two cannot drift while they agree; a
# maintainer that later needs something an act pass must not have breaks the
# alias and states why, which is one line and a comment rather than a silent
# divergence between two hand-kept copies.
#
# The three omissions carry over for their original reasons, and one is new:
#
# `wiki_finalize` is OUT. Its prune keeps `plan_ids | {landingPageId}`, so
# running it after a one-off edit would delete every page that edit did not
# touch — worse here than on the act path, since a person is watching and the
# loss would look like the edit did it.
#
# The core `read_file` is OUT, so this session needs no repository `cwd` and
# therefore never puts an indexed repository's own `.mcp.json` in the highest
# tier of `get_merged_mcp_config`. `wiki_read_file`/`wiki_grep`/
# `wiki_list_files` resolve the checkout server-side instead.
#
# `spawn_agent` is OUT. A fan-out exists to parallelise a planned page SET; a
# maintainer answers one request at a time with a person waiting on it, so a
# sub-agent would spend a second run's tokens to return through the same
# tool ceiling the root already holds.
#
# `ask_user_question` is OUT even though a human IS attached — the mint
# advertises `wiki` alone, and a capability the client never advertised would
# block the tool call until an answer nothing is listening for arrives. A
# maintainer asks in prose and the next turn answers it.

          what every refresh did before scoping existed. It also re-bootstraps

          exists to avoid.

        The submission is reconstructed from the slug-keyed ``ProjectSettings``

    """Mark a non-terminal indexing job ``interrupted`` when its session ends.

    Defense-in-depth net for tool-internal infra failures and the
    general case where a session ends without reaching ``wiki_finalize``:

    - Happy path (``wiki_finalize`` succeeded): the job is already ``complete``
      → this hook no-ops.
    - Infra failure (e.g. ``wiki_build_graph`` network error): the LLM catches
      the tool error and exits cleanly (``done_reason="completed"`` with an
      error field), but the wiki job is still ``scanning``/``queued``/etc.
      → this hook marks it ``interrupted`` so ``JobRecovery`` picks it up on
      the next restart via the existing checkpoint-aware ``WikiResume`` path.

    Fires for EVERY session end; a non-indexing session (``find_job_by_session``
    → ``None``) is a cheap no-op. A failing hook must NEVER block.

    **Reconciliation.** ``complete`` and ``cancelled`` are the statuses this
    hook treats as genuinely settled: a cancel is a deliberate user stop, so the
    session wrapping up cleanly right after is the CORRECT outcome, not a
    mismatch. For any OTHER status (``failed``, or still non-terminal —
    ``queued``/``scanning``/``finalizing``/``interrupted``) the job never
    reached ``wiki_finalize``, so a session that nonetheless ends with
    ``error=None`` (a clean ``done_reason``, per ``summarize_session``)
    disagrees with the job it belongs to: the model exited believing it
    finished, while the artifact it was building never reached its terminal
    state. This is the majority laundering case measured live — 17 of 33
    wiki-index sessions marked ``completed`` whose job was NOT ``complete``,
    most having died mid-``clone``.

    Returned as an :class:`~mewbo_core.hooks.OutcomeAssertion` so
    ``summarize_session`` can promote the session's own derived status from
    ``completed`` to ``unmet_goal`` — the return channel
    ``HookManager.run_on_session_end`` now collects. This hook is scoped to
    "no exception, but the goal wasn't met"; a true repo/network/quota block
    is a DIFFERENT case already covered by the loop's own ``blocked_code``
    path and must not be duplicated here. The job's own event log (this
    package's surface) still gets a matching entry — the SESSION-level
    assertion and the JOB-level record serve different readers (a session
    status badge vs. job forensics) and neither replaces the other.

    Registered on ``SessionRuntime.register_on_terminate`` — the same cascade

    the one lifecycle event nothing propagated into the job. The result was a
    permanent zombie: the job stayed non-terminal, kept counting as live in the
    active-jobs surface, and was picked up by restart recovery on the next boot,
    which re-started the very run the user had asked to stop for good.

    **Terminate is not session-end, and the difference is the whole design.**
    :class:`WikiIndexingSessionEndHook` fires when a RUN ends and moves the job
    to ``interrupted`` — a HANDOFF, meaning "finish this later". A terminate is
    the opposite intent and is irreversible, so the job settles at ``cancelled``
    instead, which drops it out of both the live surface and recovery's
    candidate list. Only a job still presenting as live is touched: a
    ``complete``/``cancelled``/``failed`` job already reached its outcome, and
    ``cancel_job`` on its own guards nothing but a second cancel, so it would
    happily rewrite a finished index.

    Returns ``None``, never a count. ``terminate_session`` sums an int return
    into the response's ``cancelled_triggers``, which belongs to the trigger
    store — an indexing job is not a trigger, and reporting one there would

    holds its ``RunRegistry`` slot at that point, so a same-session
    ``runtime.start_async`` is always refused (returns ``""``). A corrective
    re-drive dispatched here would spend its one-shot budget on an attempt that
    never starts and strand the answer at ``status: "running"`` forever. The
    silent-exit case is covered IN-BAND by the completion seam's
    required-terminal gate (``tool_use_loop.py``) — warm context, no
    re-admission. This hook's only job is
    to settle the answer HONESTLY when nothing caught it (``QaFinalizer.close``
    already stamps the right error) and to say so at the SESSION level via an
    :class:`~mewbo_core.hooks.OutcomeAssertion` when the close was a genuine
    surprise — the session ended clean (``error is None``) yet the answer had not
    already been closed by ``wiki_emit_answer`` itself. ``HookManager.
    run_on_session_end`` already collects these and ``summarize_session`` already
    promotes on them, so the session reads ``unmet_goal``/``recoverable=True``
    instead of a clean ``completed``.

    Fires for EVERY session end; a non-QA session (``find_qa_by_session`` → ``None``)
    is a cheap no-op.

    with INDEXER_TOOLS + the playbook" sequence — shared by :meth:`start` and the
    checkpoint-aware :class:`WikiResume.resume` so the capability advertisement,
    tool allowlist, approval callback, and model-routing options can never drift
    between the two paths (advertising the wrong capability is the classic
    "stuck after scan" bug).

    Resume guidance (``ResumePlan.summary()``) rides the *user_query* task
    description (see ``_render_resume_query``), not a separate system-prompt slot.

    ``strict_tool_scope=True`` makes ``INDEXER_TOOLS`` authoritative. Without it
    the indexer runs on the PERMISSIVE branch, which unions every non-MCP builtin
    back in regardless of this allowlist, and nothing else fills the gap: the
    AgentDef's own ``disallowedTools: [exit_plan_mode, activate_skill]``
    frontmatter is discarded by ``_load_indexer_playbook`` (body-only). Under
    strict scope INDEXER_TOOLS alone decides what the indexer can call, and that
    frontmatter line is moot rather than wrong (both tools it names are absent
    from INDEXER_TOOLS anyway). ``enable_skills=False`` keeps this headless product
    run from inheriting host ``~/.claude`` skill directories — a wiki indexer has
    no business advertising a machine-local skill set.

    *submission* carries the two operator-set, index-time fields this seam
    consumes — ``custom_instructions`` (composed into ``skill_instructions``) and
    ``mcp_servers`` (handed to ``session_mcp_servers``, which attaches them to the
    run's registry and admits their tool ids through ``INDEXER_TOOLS``). It is
    optional and ``None``-tolerant for the same reason ``_fallback_ladder`` is: a
    resume reconstructs it from the sidecar, which an old or unparseable job may
    not have. Both features then degrade to absent, which is the pre-feature
    behaviour rather than a failure.

    Note this passes the server CONFIG, never a resolved tool list: discovery is a
    network/subprocess cost, and it belongs on the run thread rather than on the
    ``POST /v1/wiki/index`` request path that reaches here.

    ⚠️ **The session ``cwd`` below is the clone directory, and the MCP config
    tier keyed on it is NOT a trust boundary today.** ``get_merged_mcp_config``
    merges ``<cwd>/.mcp.json`` at highest priority AND walks the subtree, so an
    indexed repository shipping either one would be naming processes for the
    indexing run to spawn. The only reason that does not happen is ORDERING, not
    a guard: the registry is built once in ``Orchestrator.__init__``, which runs
    before ``wiki_clone_repo`` has written anything into this directory. Anything
    that causes a registry build to happen AFTER the clone phase — a
    session-backed refresh, a mid-run rebuild, a change to when the registry is
    constructed — turns that into live arbitrary process execution driven by
    untrusted repository content. Do not read the current ordering as an
    intentional control; it is being closed separately.

    happen. The session is still created and attached to the job either way;
    only the START is refused, so a caller reading the empty return must not
    treat the job as newly sessionless.

    Stage 2 of a scoped refresh: the sessionless runner has already diffed the
    repository and decided which pages went stale, and this session rewrites
    exactly those. Called through the down-only
    ``mewbo_graph.plugins.wiki.act_launcher.ActLauncher`` seam — the library
    cannot start a Mewbo session, so the api registers a launcher whose
    implementation is this function.

    Cost: ``O(narrowed plan)`` — one doc-note read per flagged page while
    rendering the work-list. It runs on the refresh's own daemon thread, never
    a request path.

    Three decisions that look arbitrary and are not:

    **It attaches the session to the job** (``attach_job_session``), because
    that binding is what ``find_job_by_session`` resolves — and every tool on
    this ceiling reaches its project through it (``wiki_submit_page`` via
    ``resolve_job_ctx``, the source tools via ``resolve_qa_ctx`` and
    ``resolve_qa_clone_dir``, which is also what makes them read THIS job's
    live checkout rather than the previous index's). Without it the session
    would hold a full tool ceiling and be unable to use any of it.
    ``WikiIndexingSessionEndHook`` skips a scoped job for exactly this reason —
    see ``_is_scoped_refresh``.

    **It passes no ``cwd``.** The act ceiling has no filesystem tool that roots
    at one: ``wiki_read_file``/``wiki_grep``/``wiki_list_files`` resolve the
    checkout server-side from the store. Handing this session the clone
    directory would put an indexed repository's own ``.mcp.json`` in the
    highest-priority tier of ``get_merged_mcp_config`` — untrusted content
    naming processes to spawn — for no capability gained.

    **It reuses ``_compose_skill_instructions``.** The operator's standing
    guidance for a project is as relevant to rewriting a page as to writing it,
    and that composer already carries the rule that guidance may steer emphasis
    but never relax grounding.

    tier — a project-bound ctx with no job (``job_bound`` False), which is what
    lets ``wiki_submit_page`` resolve a target at all.

    **It starts no run.** The session is created READY: the context event binds
    its purpose (project, tool ceiling, strict scope, playbook, capability) and
    the person's first message drives the first turn through the ordinary
