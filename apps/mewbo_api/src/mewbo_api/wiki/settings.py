"""Editable wiki-project settings — the read/validate/write façade.

CRUD for an already-indexed wiki project's settings (model, ref, depth, language,
scope filters, dev-mode, description) — the ONE write target for them that
survives a reindex, reached through ``PATCH /v1/wiki/projects/<slug>``.

**The architectural fact this module is built around.** Two records back a "wiki
project", and only one of them is editable:

- :class:`~mewbo_graph.wiki.types.Project` is a DISPLAY snapshot, rebuilt
  WHOLESALE by ``wiki_finalize`` / ``GraphOnlyIndexer`` on every successful
  (re)index. A field written directly onto it is silently wiped by the next one —
  which is why ``desc`` is ALSO persisted as an override on the settings record
  and read back at finalize (``finalize._resolve_project_desc``).
- :class:`~mewbo_graph.wiki.types.ProjectSettings` is the durable, slug-keyed
  record of what the project is CONFIGURED with. ``WikiIndexingJob.refresh``
  consults it first, so an edit here is what actually takes effect on the next
  index.

Everything except ``desc`` therefore **takes effect on the next index**, not
immediately — this façade never triggers one (the user drives that with the
Refresh action), so a settings edit is free and can't be used to bypass
the per-IP indexing rate limiter.

Paradigm: :class:`WikiProjectSettings` is an atomic class (the
``TriggerRoutesController`` / ``VcsPickupService`` idiom) — collaborators injected
as fields, every rule a method, no module-level mutable wiring. The routes in
``routes.py`` are thin adapters that construct one per request and let its
``WikiHTTPError`` raises map to the wire through the already-registered handler.
