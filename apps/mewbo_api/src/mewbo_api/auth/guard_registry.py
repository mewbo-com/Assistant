"""The ONE process-wide :class:`PermissionGuard`, importable before it is wired.

:class:`~mewbo_api.auth.permission_guard.PermissionGuard` decorates at IMPORT
time, which in this app is boot. That creates an ordering problem the guard
itself cannot solve: a decorator needs a guard instance the moment a route
module is imported, but the only :class:`~mewbo_api.auth.kit.AuthKit` is built
part-way down ``backend.py``. A route module that imported ``backend`` at module
scope to reach it would re-open the ``backend`` ↔ routes import cycle that
``wiki/routes.py`` dodges with a lazy function-level import — and a lazy import
cannot serve a decorator, because the decorator has already run by the time any
function body executes.

This module breaks the ordering without breaking the layering. It is a LEAF: it
imports the kit and the guard and nothing else from the app, so any route module
can import it at module scope with zero cycle risk. The guard it exposes is
usable as a decorator immediately, before any kit exists.

**The mechanism is late binding, and the split is the whole design:**

* **Declaration is eager.** ``@guard.requires("users.admin")`` runs at import:
  the permission ids are validated against the closed catalog and the binding is
  recorded, so a typo is still a BOOT failure naming the handler — the
  load-bearing property of the guard, preserved exactly.
* **Enforcement is lazy.** The guard callables close over :class:`LateBoundKit`,
  which resolves the live kit at REQUEST time. Nothing reads a kit at decoration,
  so decoration before binding is well-defined rather than merely tolerated.

``backend.py`` binds the live kit once at boot (``guard_registry.bind(_auth_kit)``),
immediately after constructing it. That call is the composition root, mirroring
the ``_controller`` handle in ``triggers/routes.py``: production never reads the
module-level instance as mutable state, and a test can point the one guard at a
fresh kit by re-binding.

    guard that defers). Every one of them returns the live kit's own body and
    status unchanged; this class chooses nothing and authors no wire shape.

    ``require_permission`` is the subtle one: the guard hoists its per-permission
    guards at decoration time, so this must hand back a callable WITHOUT touching
    a kit. It returns a closure that resolves the kit on each call instead —
