"""``AuthKit`` — the one place every REST request resolves to a ``Principal``.

The kit is the app-side bridge between the identity kernel (``mewbo_iam``) and
the Flask request cycle. It does three jobs:

1. **Resolve** a request to a :class:`~mewbo_iam.Principal` (``resolve``), stored
   on ``flask.g.principal`` by one ``before_request`` mount. This NEVER rejects —
   rejection stays in the per-route guards, so the deliberately-public routes
   (``GET /api/share/<token>``, the trigger hook, channel webhooks, CORS
   preflight) keep working untouched.
2. Back the key-auth guards (``require_api_key`` / ``require_master_token``) with
   byte-for-byte the same wire contract they had as bare functions, so the ~90
   call sites and every DI'd subsystem keep working unchanged.
3. Expose a ``require_permission(perm)`` guard FACTORY, which
   :class:`~mewbo_api.auth.permission_guard.PermissionGuard` composes to enforce
   the per-route requirement every guarded handler declares.

Every refusal this module returns is minted by the typed error classes in
``mewbo_api.errors`` rather than spelled inline, so the three auth bodies have
exactly ONE definition each and a second surface cannot invent a third spelling
of them.

Design: a PLAIN atomic class (not Pydantic). It holds live, in-process
collaborators (the key store, IAM stores, the request's credential reader, a
clock) and runs on the hot path — hot runtime state that crosses no trust
boundary, the documented carve-out from the house Pydantic rule. Collaborators
are injected as fields; the IAM stores are created LAZILY on first use, so a
disabled deployment does ZERO store I/O and never writes an ``iam_*.json`` file.

When auth is disabled (the default), ``resolve`` returns a cached, full-power
principal and the guards gate nothing — the byte-identical-when-disabled law.

        headers are trivially forgeable by anyone who can reach the server

        Peer address = ``request.remote_addr``, strictly. Werkzeug populates it

        allowlist the last hop that actually connects to this server, or rewrite

        (werkzeug's ``ProxyFix``) — a transport concern, settled once at deploy

        existing guards' zero-arg, ``(body, status) | None`` shape so it drops
        into a route the same way.

        The disabled check is FIRST, and deliberately reads settings rather than
        the request: "auth off ⇒ every permission passes" must be a property of
        the configuration, not of whether a given app mounted the principal
        resolver. ``current_principal()`` reads ``g.principal``, which only
        exists where the kit's ``before_request`` runs — so a blueprint mounted
        on a bare app (the wiki blueprint's tests do exactly this) would
        otherwise find no principal and reject EVERY request, turning a disabled
        deployment into a locked one and breaking the byte-identical-when-disabled
        law. Note the asymmetry: with auth ENABLED an absent principal still
        fails closed (401), which is the correct reading of a surface that
        enforces permissions without resolving identity.

        **Scopes NARROW the role grant; they never widen it, and admin is not
        exempt from the narrowing.** A key minted with ``roles=["admin"]`` and
        ``scopes=[]`` (explicitly none) must authorize NOTHING — that is the
        self-mint escalation this closes: since the intersection can only
        subtract from what the role already grants, a broader `scopes` value
        can never manufacture a permission the role does not hold. `scopes is
        None` (unrestricted — the disabled-auth and master principals, and any
        key record carrying no ``scopes`` field) is a no-op here, so this is
        byte-identical for every principal that never carried scopes to begin
        with. `KeyScopes` is the ONE matcher (`mewbo_core.secrets.key_store`) every
        scope check in the codebase shares, including the self-mint delegation
        check this mirrors — never re-derive the three-state/wildcard rule here.
