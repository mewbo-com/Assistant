"""``JobRecovery.recover_interrupted`` must not let a
``ResumeCountError`` refusal consume a slug's retry-cap attempt.

The trap this pins: bumping the per-slug counter BEFORE calling
``WikiResume.resume`` — unconditionally, whether the resume succeeded, failed,
or was refused. Once ``ResumePlan.build`` started failing closed (raising
``ResumeCountError`` instead of silently returning 0 on a transient store-read
glitch), three glitches in a row would exhaust ``MAX_RETRIES`` and permanently
fail a job that never actually failed — swapping a silent full-rebuild for a
silent permanent failure, which is worse. A refusal must leave the job exactly
as it was, with its retry budget untouched.
