"""Contract tests for session purpose-binding (``SessionSpec``) and its routing legs.

Driven from the caller's seam — real Flask routes, real serialisation, real
context persistence — stubbing only ``start_async`` (the I/O boundary) so each
test asserts what the run was actually dispatched WITH.

The defect these exist to pin: ``POST /sessions/<id>/query`` was the only
re-engage path that never read the session's persisted binding. It re-derived
the model from config, dropped the tool ceiling when the request omitted one,
never read the strict-scope flag, fell back to an empty per-session temp dir —
and then PERSISTED those defaults, corrupting every later ``/message`` and
``/recover``.
