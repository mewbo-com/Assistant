    The policy is consulted AT REGISTRATION (``server._registrar``): a withheld
    group's tools are never handed to ``@mcp.tool()``, so FastMCP never builds
    their schema and they exist in neither ``list_tools`` nor dispatch. This is
    deliberately NOT a post-hoc prune — a tool that is never constructed cannot
    be forgotten about, and the gate sits at the line a future author actually
    edits (every registration must name its :class:`ToolGroup`, so a new tool
    cannot be added without an exposure decision).

    It is data + one predicate (:meth:`allows`); the registration itself is the
    server's job, because it touches FastMCP (a model never imports I/O).

    **A tool is exposed only if BOTH axes allow it** — its :class:`ToolGroup`
    (which subsystem) and its :class:`EffectTier` (what it does). Neither axis
    alone can express the policy this facade needs: the group axis cannot say
    "wiki reads but not wiki asks", and the tier axis cannot say "read the wiki
    but not the search product". Conjunction says both.

    **Search, structured query, integrations and triggers are withheld by
    DEFAULT** — see :data:`_DEFAULT_EXPOSURE`. Nothing here touches the engine:
    ``scg.enabled`` stays on and ``/api/agentic_search/*`` keeps serving the
    console, because MCP reaches search only over REST. Note the standing caveat
    from ``CLAUDE.md``: this facade is *curation, not a security boundary* — a
    key-holding caller can still reach the REST routes directly.

    Two env vars override, one per axis: ``MEWBO_MCP_EXPOSED_GROUPS`` and
    ``MEWBO_MCP_EXPOSED_TIERS``. Each is a comma-separated ALLOWLIST (fail-closed
    — naming a member is the only way to expose it), and an unknown name is a
    hard startup error, never a silent no-op.
