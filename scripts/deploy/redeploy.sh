# mechanism:
#
#   (a) compose's own `${VAR}` interpolation (the MEWBO_*_SRC / *_DIST mount
#       paths in docker-compose.override.yml) reads the process environment
#       compose itself runs in.
#   (b) each service's `env_file: ${MEWBO_ENV_FILE:-.env}` names an actual
#       file on disk — `env_file:` cannot read the process environment, only
#       a path — so that leg still needs a materialized file even though (a)
#       does not.
#
# `ssm run -- docker compose ...` below covers (a): it injects the resolved
# secrets straight into docker compose's own environment, no temp file
# involved for that leg. Leg (b) is covered by materializing into a private
# temp directory that shreds on exit, so a checkout — or a stray
# `git add -f` — can never carry the file. `ssm run` inherits the calling
# shell's exported vars (verified: MEWBO_ENV_FILE survives into its child),
# so exporting it once here is enough for every compose call below.

# console-first ordering) is downstream of it and never runs. A materialize
# is a fast pre-flight — resolve a token, one HTTP call the CLI already
# bounds — so 120s is far past any healthy run. Only THIS call is bounded:
# the `compose` builds below legitimately take many minutes, and they stream
# docker output continuously, so a stall there is both slow by design and
# visible. Do not "complete the pattern" by wrapping them too.

# newer system package) was missing with nothing in the output to say why.

# Cached on purpose, unlike api/mewbo-mcp below: this layer set includes Node and

# and package-lock.json busts `npm ci` whenever the dependencies do. There is
# no uv/pip resolution step here for a stale cache to hide, so --no-cache
# would only re-download node_modules on every redeploy for nothing.
#
# It MUST be listed explicitly: `up -d --pull never` starts whatever image
# already carries the tag and never builds, so leaving it out silently
# redeploys the api against a stale broker. The two sides share a wire
# contract with extra="forbid" on both ends, so a stale broker is not a
