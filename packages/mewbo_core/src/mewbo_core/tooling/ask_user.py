"""Ask-the-user question tool — native human-in-the-loop clarification.

The Mewbo analog of the ask-user-question tools interactive coding harnesses
ship natively: the agent calls ``ask_user_question`` with 1-4 structured
questions, the run BLOCKS until a human answers, and the chosen answers
return directly as the tool result.

Blocking forever is the DEFAULT, not the only mode. A call may name its own
``timeout_seconds``; when that elapses the tool resolves ``timed_out`` — an
ordinary result the model reads and acts on, never an error — and the run
carries on. There is deliberately no default-answer concept and no
``on_timeout`` policy field: the two moves after an unanswered question
(proceed on the task's own terms, or stop and wait) are both already
available to the model, and what it lacked was an outcome it could read.

**A question is answerable until it is ANSWERED.** A timeout, a supersede,
even a process restart do not close it — only an answer does, and only a
terminated session refuses one. Because the ``user_question`` event is
durable, a host can recover a question's arguments from the transcript long
after the waiter departed and deliver the late answer as a new turn; that is
what makes "the user was away" a recoverable situation rather than a lost
decision. See ``apps/mewbo_api/src/mewbo_api/ask_user.py`` for the concrete
late-answer routing.

The split mirrors ``client_tools.py`` exactly: core owns the ``SessionTool``
(:class:`AskUserQuestionTool`), the wire/validation contract (the Pydantic
models below), and the down-only DI seam (:class:`QuestionDispatcher`); each
host registers its concrete transport half at startup (the api's
SSE-event + HTTP-answer dispatcher, the CLI's blocking-modal dispatcher).
Core never imports up.

The tool is CONDITIONALLY BOUND, never registered as a plugin factory: a run
gets it only when the querying client advertised the :data:`ASK_USER_CAPABILITY`
capability (``X-Mewbo-Capabilities`` → ``context.client_capabilities``),
via the api's ``_derive_tool_grants`` → ``extra_session_tools`` seam — the
same advertise-and-answer-at-one-seam pattern device tools use. Headless
drives (triggers, wiki, search, channels) never advertise it, so the tool
simply does not exist for them and nothing ever blocks waiting for a user
who is not there. ``extra_session_tools`` are not forwarded to spawned
children, so the tool is structurally ROOT-ONLY — a sub-agent reports its
open questions through its result instead of interrogating the user
mid-fan-out.
