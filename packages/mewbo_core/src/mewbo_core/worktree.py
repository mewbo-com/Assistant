"""Git worktree management.

Thin subprocess wrapper around ``git worktree`` for creating, listing,
inspecting, and removing branch-bound worktrees rooted under
``<repo>/.mewbo/worktrees/<slug>/``.

Design rules (KISS):

* One worktree per branch. Directory name is the slugified branch name.
  No separate ``name`` field, no rename, no collision handling beyond what
  git itself enforces.
* All operations are git subprocess calls — no extra dependencies.
* "Clean" means ``git status --porcelain`` is empty AND there are no commits
  ahead of upstream (auto-cleanup default for worktrees with no unique commits).
* The caller (``project_store``) decides whether to persist a record;
  this module deals with the filesystem and git only.
