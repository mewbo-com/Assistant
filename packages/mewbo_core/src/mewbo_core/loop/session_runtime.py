    strictly the cheaper correction and it stays the first line. This gate is
    what remains when the nudges are spent and the session has already ended
    ``unmet_goal`` — the case a human otherwise fixes by clicking Continue,
    which routinely produces the missing result in ONE further step.

    **Exactly one automatic attempt, ever.** The ledger is the ``recovery``
    transcript event the recovery path already writes: this gate stamps it with
    ``trigger="auto_goal_unmet"``, and refuses whenever a marker carrying that
    trigger is already present. Durable, restart-proof, and no new store field.

    Cost ceiling — state it plainly, because nothing else in the system bounds a
    session's token spend (``TokenBudget`` is compaction accounting, not a wallet):
    **one additional run per session, whose own cost is bounded only by that
    run's step/wall budget.** Worst case a session costs twice what it otherwise
    would. That is the entire price, and it cannot compound: the second run's
    terminal reaches this gate too, finds its own marker, and refuses.

    ``action="continue"`` is load-bearing, not a preference. ``retry`` truncates
    the transcript back past the failed turn, which would delete the marker and
    make the one-shot guard structurally impossible to enforce.

    Cost class: ``O(one record)`` — one digest fold plus one transcript read for
    the marker scan, on a terminal path, once per run.

        ``O(collection)`` in rows, and never ``O(all history)`` in reads. TWO
        batched store calls serve the whole page, and neither scales with how
        much any session has recorded:

        * :meth:`~SessionStoreBase.list_session_digests` returns each session's
          transcript reduced to the events a summary folds. A per-id
          ``load_transcript`` here would make a listing read every event ever
          stored, and degrade monotonically forever.
        * ``load_session_records`` returns the metadata that is stored ON the
          session rather than folded from events (title, archived, terminated,
          owner, tags, ``pinned_at``, ``projects``) in one call for the page
          instead of per-row reads.

        **`query` narrows the digest fetch itself, and that ORDER is what makes
        it compose with a page.** The whole query goes to
        ``list_session_digests`` (still called EXACTLY ONCE per listing, which a
        test pins), so every predicate answerable from the session record —
        ``owner``/``archived``/``pinned``/``projects`` — is applied by the store
        before it decides which candidates to page, and a session the query
        rejects is never opened. Filtering afterwards instead would be worse
        than merely slower once ``limit`` exists: paging first and filtering the
        page would make ``pinned=True`` return only the pinned sessions inside
        the newest N candidates, which is usually none of them.

        **The fold itself is unchanged and still single-sourced.**
        ``summarize_session`` sees a smaller event list, not a different
        derivation — re-deriving a row's fields with a store-side aggregation
        would be a second implementation, free to drift until a row disagrees
        with the session it names.

        **``limit``/``offset`` bound how many CANDIDATES this call examines, not
        how many rows it is guaranteed to return.** They page
        ``list_session_digests`` after *query* has narrowed the candidate set but
        before the two VISIBILITY rules below run, which is what lets a
        Mongo-backed store scope its expensive read to the page instead of the
        whole collection (see that method's docstring for the measured saving) —
        but a candidate dropped below (no visible event and not running, or no
        ``created_at``) shrinks the page rather than being backfilled from the
        next one. Those two rules stay here because they are the only ones that
        need the transcript's EVENTS, so no store query can decide them; they
        are hygiene rather than user filters, which is why shrinkage is
        acceptable for them and would not have been for ``pinned``.
        ``limit=None`` (the default) is an unpaginated call.

        Ordering is **pinned first, then newest first.** Two stable sorts
        rather than one composite key: the second pass only has to move pinned
        rows to the front, and stability preserves the recency order the first
        pass established within each group. Pinning is applied HERE, as an
        ordering over what the query already admitted — never as a way around
        it. A caller that hides an origin keeps hiding it when the row is
        pinned, because filtering a sorted list preserves relative order. That
        is what makes "a mobile surface shows only its own pinned sessions"
        true by construction, with no surface-specific branch anywhere in this
        method.
