"""Plan-mode approval gating: ``ExitPlanMode`` internal tool.

In plan mode, the LLM explores the codebase with read-only tools and drafts a
plan to ``/tmp/mewbo/plans/<session_id>/plan.md`` using the configured edit
tool (path-scoped at the permission layer). When the plan is ready the LLM
calls ``exit_plan_mode`` — this module's handler reads the plan file, emits a
``plan_proposed`` event, and signals the loop to terminate so the thread exits
cleanly. Approval/rejection is handled episodically by ``SessionRuntime``.

Follows the internal-tool-schema pattern from ``spawn_agent.py`` and
``skills.py``: the schema is injected into ``bind_tools()``, but the tool is
NOT registered in the ``ToolRegistry``. Dispatch happens inside
``ToolUseLoop._execute_tool_call``.

  - ``$`` / `` ` `` — variable expansion / command substitution

The same characters appearing *inside* a single- or double-quoted argument

allowlist-escape risk, so they are permitted. See

      other quote types recognized) until the closing ``'``.
    - Inside double quotes, metachars are literal data to the shell,
      so they are NOT flagged; only ``"`` closes the quoted region.
    - Outside any quotes, a backslash escapes the next character as a
      literal, but the escaped char is still considered "unquoted" —
      ``\\|`` at the command level would let the model smuggle a pipe
      through a second allowlist-evasion syntax, so a backslash
      followed by a metachar is rejected.
