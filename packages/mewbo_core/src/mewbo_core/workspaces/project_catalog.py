"""The one place a project name becomes a directory, and the one place they are listed.

Four unrelated things in this tree are called a "project", and only the first
three are filesystem workspaces an agent can run in:

1. A **configured** project — :class:`~mewbo_core.config.ProjectConfig`, a
   directory an operator registered by hand in ``app.json``. Mewbo only ever
   points at it; it never creates, moves or deletes one.
2. A **managed** project — :class:`~mewbo_core.workspaces.project_store.VirtualProject`,
   a directory Mewbo created and owns. Addressed as ``managed:<project_id>``.
3. A **worktree** — a managed project with ``is_worktree`` set, which is a
   child checkout of another managed project on its own branch.
4. A **repository** — :class:`~mewbo_core.workspaces.repositories.Repository`, a git
   remote identity. Registration is INERT, so a repository has NO path until
   somebody checks it out; it is listed here so a caller can see that it
   exists, and refused by :meth:`ProjectCatalog.resolve` until it does.

(A wiki ``Project`` is an INDEX of a repository, not a workspace, and is
deliberately absent from this catalog.)

"Project name to path" has five call sites across the API app, and a private
resolution at each one drifts in the direction nobody watches: an endpoint that
resolves a configured project but returns nothing for ``managed:<id>`` scopes a
worktree-backed session to the unscoped list, with no error to read. One
resolver is what makes the agent-facing switch tool a thin caller rather than a
sixth divergent copy.

**This lives in core, not in the app, for the same reason the repository
registry does:** the CLI drives the tool-use loop in-process with no
``mewbo_api`` present, and the tools that consume this are core. An app-side
home would put the resolver above two of its own callers in the DAG.
