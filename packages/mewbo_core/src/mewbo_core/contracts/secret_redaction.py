"""Redact secret values out of every log record at the single sink chokepoint.

``SecretRedactor`` is a pure, I/O-free atomic class. One instance is installed
as loguru's global patcher (``logger.configure(patcher=...)``) so every record —
the interpolated message text and the bound ``extra`` mapping — is scrubbed
before any handler writes it. The same instance is usable directly at a
deliberate-dump call site (``redact_mapping``) to scrub a payload BEFORE it is
interpolated into a message, which is where key-name heuristics still apply: by
patcher time the arguments have already been formatted into the message string
and only the value-SHAPE heuristics can still recognise a secret.

``install_stdlib_log_bridge`` routes the standard ``logging`` module's records
into loguru so third-party libraries (litellm, langfuse, httpx, ldap3, pymongo,
werkzeug) are scrubbed by the SAME patcher — the bridge only reroutes, it never
redacts on its own.

Two heuristics, deliberately conservative:

* **Key-name** — a dict key / env-var name whose (camelCase-split) form contains
  ``token``/``secret``/``password``/``passwd``/``bearer``/``authorization``/
  ``credential``/``apikey``, or has ``key`` as a whole token, marks its value as
  secret. This is the strong heuristic — it catches an arbitrary-shaped value —
  but it only works on structured data (``extra`` and explicit ``redact_mapping``
  call sites), not on a value already flattened into a message string.
* **Value-shape** — a small, documented set of vendor-published token prefixes
  (``ghp_``/``github_pat_``/``sk-``/``xox?-``/``AKIA``/``AIza``/JWT), a
  ``Bearer <token>`` scheme, and ``secret_key=value`` pairs in a stringified
  mapping. This is the net that still fires once a secret has landed in free
  text, where the key name is gone.

Redaction output is always ``<redacted len=N>``, revealing at most the length.

Fail-safe: any exception inside the redactor degrades the record to a
``[redaction-error]`` marker with its payload dropped — an unscrubbable record
must never ship raw.
