"""Custom system-instructions contracts — the render context + the stored doc.

Two Pydantic models at two different trust boundaries:

* :class:`InstructionContext` is the **public variable contract** handed to the
  operator's Jinja template. Every field is deterministic plain data (no live
  objects, no callables) because the template is operator-authored and rendered
  in a sandbox — a callable in scope is an escape hatch. The API serves this
  model's ``model_json_schema()`` as the variable reference the console renders,
  which is why every field carries a ``description``.
* :class:`SystemInstructionsDoc` is the persisted document (a singleton keyed by
  ``id``) AND the renderer of its own template: an oversized template is rejected
  at definition (the write boundary), while :meth:`SystemInstructionsDoc.render`
  turns any broken or hostile template into "inject nothing" rather than a dead
  turn.
