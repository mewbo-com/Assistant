    Two normalizations ride this one seam — token usage (below) and tool NAMES
    (:class:`_ToolNameNormalizer`) — because both are defects in what the
    provider/proxy returns rather than in how the engine drives it, and this
    wrapper is the last point before ``langchain-litellm`` converts the raw
    response into an ``AIMessage``. Rewriting the name here fixes BOTH slots the
    adapter populates from it (``AIMessage.tool_calls`` and
    ``additional_kwargs.tool_calls``) with one write.

    Surface token usage that litellm strands in ``_hidden_params``.

    litellm can leave the real token counts in ``response._hidden_params``
    instead of ``response.usage``: streaming chunks have usage *stripped* from
    the emitted chunk and re-attached only to ``_hidden_params``
    (``streaming_handler.py``, the ``stream_options is None`` path), and some
    proxy/provider non-streaming shapes never populate the field either.
    ``langchain-litellm`` then builds ``usage_metadata`` from ``model_dump()``
    /``response.get("usage")`` — both of which read empty because
    ``_hidden_params`` is a private attribute — so every ``llm_call_end`` token
    count collapses to zero (upstream litellm#12233 /
    litellm#17476, no fix release as of litellm 1.88.0).

    This shim copies the stranded usage back onto the field the adapter reads,
    for both the non-streaming response and every streaming chunk. It is
    feature-detecting, not version-sniffing: it acts ONLY when ``usage`` is
    absent/all-zero, so it is a no-op the moment upstream (or the proxy) puts
    usage on the field — remove it once that ships. ``client`` is injected (the
    real ``litellm`` module), and every other attribute delegates through.
