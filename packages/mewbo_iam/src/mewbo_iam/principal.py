"""The authenticated caller — ``Principal`` — plus the identity primitives.

A ``Principal`` is the resolved, request-scoped identity every guard reasons
about: who they are (``subject``), how they proved it (``auth_method``), what
roles they carry, which teams they belong to, and — for service accounts — the
optional signed ``scopes`` that narrow them. It is frozen: a principal is built
once per request and never mutated.

Models here never touch I/O. ``effective_permissions`` takes already-resolved
role records as an argument (the caller reads them from a role store); the
avatar strategy takes a policy object. The clock, HTTP headers and IdP claims
never appear inside these methods.
