"""``AuthSettings`` — the validated, boot-time shape of the ``api.auth`` block.

Core's ``config.py`` may only carry the auth block as opaque ``dict``/``list``
fields (it must never import this kernel — the DAG flows core → iam → apps), so
the deep, typed validation of that block lives HERE, at the trust boundary the
app crosses at boot. :meth:`AuthSettings.from_config_block` turns the raw config
dict into typed settings — the full authenticator discriminated union, the
group→role/team mappings, the bootstrap rule, and the session/avatar/scim/audit
sub-settings — with ``extra="forbid"`` so a smuggled or misspelled key is a clean
error, not a silent no-op. The AuthKit validates the raw block through this model
at app construction and refuses to boot when it does not parse.

Models never import I/O: this file parses config data only. Runtime probing
(whether an authenticator kind's optional driver dependency is installed) is the
AuthKit's job, not the model's.
