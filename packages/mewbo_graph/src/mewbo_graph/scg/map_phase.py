"""Map-job phase-progress sink — a dependency-injection seam (down-only).

A map job's progress is persisted in the API *run* store so it rides the
``RunSseGenerator`` plumbing the search UI already tails — an API/transport
concern, deliberately NOT in this engine. The relocated ``scg`` SessionTools
must still report phase transitions (``finalize`` etc.) without importing
**up** into ``mewbo_api``.

So the API registers a concrete writer here at startup
(``MapPhaseSink.register(...)``) and the plugin emits through it. With no sink
registered — a core/graph-only install, or the API never initialised — every
emit is a no-op returning ``None``: the SCG structure write already happened,
the phase write is purely cosmetic progress, so its absence never fails a map.

This mirrors the wiki ``emit_phase`` invariant (one write feeds both the
SSE-tailed indexing page and the snapshot-polling landing card) while keeping
the layering acyclic — the wiki helper can write its own (relocated) store
directly; the map-job sink writes the API's run store, so it must be injected.
