"""The Q&A retrieval-trail contract — a bounded, score-ranked access record.

A wiki-qa probe BOTH navigates the code graph (unranked walks over thousands of
edges) AND grounds against ranked search hits. Only the ranked grounding hits +
a handful of confirmation reads belong on the answer's "retrieval details" trail;
unranked graph navigation must NEVER flood it (a real run recorded ~200 nodes
while only ~7 were cited). ``QaAccessRecord`` is the ONE typed shape every
retrieval tool emits and ``QaFinalizer._accessed_from_events`` folds — it carries
an optional ranking ``score`` so the fold can dedupe-by-ref, score-order, and cap
to a tight top-N.

Producer side (the plugin tools, importing this DOWN):
    * scored search hits → :meth:`from_ranked_hits` (drops the marginal tail at a
      ratio of the top hit's score, carrying the real ``score``/``rank``);
    * a navigation seed or a file/page read → :meth:`touch` (unscored).

Consumer side (``mewbo_graph.wiki.qa``, same layer): :meth:`from_event` parses an
``access`` event back into records (bare-``refs`` shape included) and
:meth:`fold` produces the bounded, ordered ``accessed_sources`` ref list.
