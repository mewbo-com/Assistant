"""On-demand incremental refresh — change detection + scoped graph delta.

The refresh control plane recomputes *only* the scope a diff
touches, across graph → memory → docs. This module hosts the first two atomic
stages; memory reconciliation, doc staleness, and the plan-then-act
orchestrator land alongside them.

* ``ChangeDetector`` — content-hash diff of the working tree vs the persisted
  ``FileManifest`` (mtime is unreliable across checkouts; hashing is robust and
  collapses N stacked commits into one end-state comparison — the Mimir
  pattern). Produces an ``added / modified / deleted`` ``ChangeSet``.
* ``GraphDeltaIndexer`` — retracts the stale graph for dirty files, re-parses
  ``modified ∪ added``, and computes the **affected-entity set** Δ via a
  reverse-dependency closure (CodePlan change-may-impact). Salsa-style early
  cutoff: a file whose re-parse yields identical entity/edge signatures
  contributes nothing downstream.
* ``ScopedEdgeResolver`` — the delta path's faithful-resolution leg. A raw
  re-parse emits cross-file edges by NAME, so without it every scoped refresh
  degraded the edges the full ``graph`` phase had resolved exactly, and a
  project's resolved graph decayed one refresh at a time.

    """Faithful symbol resolution applied to the DIRTY scope of a refresh.

    A scoped refresh re-parses only the files a diff touched, and a raw
    tree-sitter re-parse emits cross-file edges BY NAME. Persisting those is not
    a neutral choice: the full ``graph`` phase replaces the same edges with the
    resolver's exact ones, so every scoped refresh that skipped resolution
    overwrote a resolved file's edges with name-matched ones and the project's
    resolved graph decayed monotonically, one refresh at a time.

    **Why the resolver runs over the WHOLE clone and not just the dirty files.**
    scip indexes per ``[project]`` root, and a reference in a dirty file usually
    points at a definition in a file the diff never touched — hand the resolver
    the dirty nodes alone and every such reference resolves to nothing, which is
    the same edge loss wearing a cheaper disguise. So the resolver gets the whole
    project's node view (``universe``: the re-parsed dirty nodes plus the store's
    nodes for every untouched file) and the OUTPUT is what gets scoped: only
    edges whose source file is dirty are kept, because those are the only files
    whose edges :meth:`GraphDeltaIndexer.apply` retracted. An untouched file's
    edges stay exactly as the last full index left them — a refresh repairs the
    scope it owns, never the whole graph.

    The leg is optional at BOTH layers, the same way every other collaborator
    here is: an indexer built with no resolver, or one whose binaries are absent
    (``ScipPythonResolver.is_available()``, probed inside :attr:`apply`), keeps
    today's behaviour byte-for-byte — the raw edges pass straight through in
    input order. It also never fails a refresh: a resolver that raises degrades
    to the raw edges with a warning, because a name-matched graph is worse than a
    resolved one but far better than an interrupted refresh.

    Cost: ``O(repo)`` — a scip subprocess per project root plus one union read of
    the project's nodes. That is offline-class work and it belongs to a refresh
    JOB, never to a request path; :attr:`suffixes` is what keeps a docs-only diff
    from paying it at all.

        ``embedder`` reaches all THREE stages that need one — the graph delta
        re-embeds what it re-parses, the reconciler measures anchor drift with
        it, and the doc planner holds it for the drift term. Handing it to only
        the latter two is what left a refreshed graph unvectorised.

        It is RESOLVED here when the caller passes none, rather than being read
        as "skip embedding". Every OTHER stage degrades harmlessly without one,
        so threading a bare ``None`` down looked correct — but the graph stage
        does not degrade harmlessly: it has already deleted the previous
        vectors by the time it would embed, so a missing embedder there does
        not mean "leave things as they were", it means "strip the vectors off
        everything this refresh touched". Since this classmethod is the only
        way a production caller builds the composer, resolving the default
        HERE is the difference between the delta path embedding and silently
        not.

        The switch is consulted ONLY on that default. An explicitly injected
        embedder overrides it, as does constructing the stages directly — a DI
        seam an operator setting could veto would be the worse design, and
        tests have to be able to inject a fake regardless of deployment config.
        So read this as "the switch decides what the DEFAULT is", never as "the
        switch decides whether embedding happens": someone debugging why a
        refresh still embeds after they turned embedding off is looking for an
        injected collaborator, not for a bug here.

        The ``wiki.refresh.*`` thresholds are read HERE for the same reason, and
        the reason is worth stating because the failure mode is invisible: the
        three stages take every threshold as a keyword argument whose default
        equals the config default, so a stage built with none of them behaves
        EXACTLY like a correctly configured one on a default deployment. An
        operator who retunes a threshold sees no error and no effect. Reading
        them at the one composition root a production caller uses, and passing
        them down as arguments, keeps the stages pure DI — a stage that read
        config itself could not be constructed in a test without one, and a
        directly-constructed stage would silently start obeying a deployment
        setting a test had no way to see.

        ``resolver`` is resolved here on the same argument, and it is the reason
        the argument is worth making twice. A scoped refresh re-parses files the
        full ``graph`` phase had already resolved faithfully, so a delta stage
        built with no resolver does not merely skip an improvement — it OVERWRITES
        resolved edges with name-matched ones, every refresh, until a project's
        cross-file graph is gone. There is no config switch: the leg gates itself
        on ``ScipPythonResolver.is_available()`` and reports which way it went, so
        a deployment without the binaries lands on exactly its prior behaviour.
        ``on_report`` is where that line goes — default the module logger, so the
        degradation is never silent; a caller with a job log should pass its own
        emitter so the answer lives beside the refresh it describes.
