        a supersede that never ran, or the field-absent rows the isolation

# interactive, and the reason is the BSON array encoding rather than the
# arithmetic: every element of a 3072-d array carries its own index key plus an
# 8-byte double, so one document costs ~42 KB and scoring one project's 61,774
# vectors meant pulling ~2.6 GB off the wire and decoding it into ~190 million
# Python floats before the first comparison. Measured on that project, the two
# legs cost 34.1 s of fetch and 23.4 s of scoring; the same vectors as a packed
# buffer are ~12 KB each and reach NumPy through a single ``frombuffer`` with no
# per-element Python object at all, taking the whole search to 3.9 s.
#
# NumPy alone does NOT fix this — measured at 42.9 s, because the BSON decode is
# the floor and only scoring got faster. The storage change is the load-bearing
# half.
#
# float32 is not a precision compromise worth worrying about: against the
