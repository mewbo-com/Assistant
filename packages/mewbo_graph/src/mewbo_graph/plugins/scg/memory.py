"""``scg_memory`` SessionTool — the learned-layer flywheel over the SCG.

One tool, two operations over the shared #13 memory substrate (corpus
``connector``) via :class:`ScgMemoryBridge`:

* ``operation="write"`` — deposit a durable connector insight (a data-location
  win, a failure constraint, a resolved binding, a learned edge-weight hint)
  anchored to ``source_keys``. This is the search agent's deposit step: facts
  written now bias every future traversal (the Exa Fast/Auto/Deep flywheel).
* ``operation="read"`` — embed *query* and return the top-*k* connector insights
  to seed traversal. Read-only.

There is ZERO re-implementation of the atomic-note / anchor / dedup machinery —
the bridge routes through the shared ``InsightIngestor`` and the store's
``memory_vector_search`` ANN seam. The in-session deposit is deterministic (no
LLM dedup tier-3 — ``llm`` is not injected).

Security invariant (spec §6): a connector insight is a propositional fact about
*reachability* — never a record value, token, or credential.

    This is the flywheel that makes the graph compound: after you ACT on what

    (search, structured, or plain chat) inherits it. `operation="write"` records
    one durable reachability fact anchored to `source_keys`, with `polarity`:
    `positive` (this pathway produced results — future routing boosts it) or
    `dead_end` (it returned nothing for this question — routing damps it).
    `operation="read"` embeds a query and returns the top-k learned insights to
    seed your planning. A note's job is to INDEX A USE CASE, never to describe
    a tool: encode the path that connects capabilities through the domain
    objects inside them ("for question class Q about object O, traverse
    capability A's field f into capability B") and anchor it to EVERY
    source_key on the path — multi-anchor notes are the graph's cross-tool
    connective tissue, and each one pre-pays exploration so future agents
    traverse instead of rediscovering (fewer tool calls, fewer tokens).
    Deposit propositional facts about WHERE/HOW to reach data (a binding, a
    constraint, a working parameter shape) — NEVER a record value, token, or
    credential. A deposit from any session is attributed to the bound
    workspace, or to the session when unscoped, and is visible to every future
    task — so user-deployed tasks curate the shared graph toward their purpose.
