"""``agentic_search`` SessionTool — kick off a full Mewbo Search, fetch later.

The high-level counterpart to the low-level graph tools (``scg_route`` /
``scg_observe``): instead of routing and traversing the SCG yourself, hand a
natural-language question to a dedicated ``scg-search`` SESSION that decomposes
it, fans probes across the workspace's connectors, and synthesises a cited
answer. Use the graph tools when you want to inspect reachability directly; use
this when you want a finished, cited answer.

Because a search session can run for minutes, this tool is **async by handle**:

* Call with ``query`` → it starts the run and returns IMMEDIATELY with a
  ``run_id`` and ``status:"processing"`` (it never blocks your loop). A run that
  finishes synchronously, or a recent completed run for the SAME question
  (idempotent — no duplicate launch), comes back fully formed in one call.
* Call again with that ``run_id`` → the last-known cited answer plus the
  timestamp it was computed (``computed_at``), or ``status:"processing"`` while
  it is still running.

The run lives in its own auditable session/record and is driven through the
api-registered :class:`~mewbo_graph.scg.search_launcher.SearchLauncher` seam
(read-only connector grants only — a search never mutates a source).
