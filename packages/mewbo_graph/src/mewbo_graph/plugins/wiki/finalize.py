    The two failure shapes are NOT the same question, and conflating them makes
    this gate toothless:

    - ``NotImplementedError`` — the graph BACKEND is absent, by design, on a
      lean graph-less install. That is a known capability gap rather than
      uncertainty, and a BM25-only wiki must still be allowed to finalize.
    - Anything else — the read did not happen, so nothing here knows whether the
      graph is populated. That fails CLOSED: answering ``True`` would let a
      transient store error launder an unverified (possibly empty) graph into a
      ``complete`` index. Refusing costs one re-drive; the recovery path re-runs
