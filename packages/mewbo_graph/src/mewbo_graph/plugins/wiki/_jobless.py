"""``JoblessIndexRunner`` — the scaffolding every SESSIONLESS runner shares.

Two runners drive a wiki job with no Mewbo session and no LLM agent behind them:
:class:`~mewbo_graph.plugins.wiki.graph_only.GraphOnlyIndexer` (developer mode's
deterministic ``clone → scan → graph → finalize``) and
:class:`~mewbo_graph.plugins.wiki.scoped_refresh.ScopedRefreshRunner` (the
incremental refresh's deterministic Free tier). They differ only in their TAIL
phases; their head — clone the repo, walk the tree, poll for a cooperative
cancel, record a terminal failure, and never leak an exception into the daemon
thread — is the same ~120 lines.

**Why this lives in its own module rather than beside either runner.** Putting
it in ``scoped_refresh.py`` would make the older, simpler runner import the
newer, more specialised one, so a future third runner would inherit from
whichever file happened to be written second. A leading underscore matches the
suite's other shared-internals modules (``_ctx``, ``_base``, ``_platform_api``)
and marks it as a seam for this package, not a public entry point.

The specialisation is a TEMPLATE METHOD: :meth:`JoblessIndexRunner.run` iterates
whatever :meth:`JoblessIndexRunner._phases` returns, so a subclass declares its
pipeline as data and inherits the cancellation, failure and never-raise
behaviour rather than re-implementing them next to its own tail.
