    Isolated so tests can force the resolver on/off without the external CLIs.
    The ``wiki/resolve`` package is pure-Python (its scip backends are
    subprocesses) but lives behind the ``mewbo-graph[resolve]`` extra, so the
    import is guarded — an install without it degrades cleanly to tree-sitter-only
    edges, exactly as today.

    """Swap tree-sitter's name-matched Python edges for the resolver's exact ones.

    The tree-sitter extractor emits cross-file IMPORTS/CALLS/EXTENDS edges *by
    name* — every same-named symbol collapses onto one node. When the faithful
    ``ScipPythonResolver`` is available it resolves those EXACTLY (real ``node_id``
    targets, ``target_name=None``), so for PYTHON source files we drop the
    synthetic name-matched edges and substitute the resolver's. Everything else is
    untouched: ``CONTAINS`` (structural, all languages) and the non-Python
    synthetic edges (Go/Rust/TS keep tree-sitter resolution until they get a
    backend) flow through unchanged. The resolver's descriptor-keyed ``External``
    nodes are persisted alongside the real nodes so its real-id edges survive the
    view's ``target in node_ids`` endpoint check.

    Degrades to a byte-identical ``result`` when the resolver can't run (binaries
    absent / extra uninstalled) or indexes nothing (``not res.available``) — NO
    behaviour change from the tree-sitter-only path.

    **Superseding is all-or-nothing across the repository, and that is a
    deliberate floor rather than the shape we would choose.** ``available`` is
    merely "at least one root was indexed", so superseding on it alone would let
    a pass that indexed 6 of 9 roots drop the name-matched edges of ALL NINE —
    leaving the three roots the resolver never reached with no cross-file edges
    whatsoever, which is worse than the guesses it removed. The precise repair
    is per-root: drop only the
    edges whose source file sits under a root that actually indexed. That is not
    derivable here — ``ResolutionResult``/``ResolutionStats`` carry root COUNTS
    and no root identities, so this asks :attr:`GraphResolution.faithful` for the
    conservative question it CAN answer ("did every discovered root index?") and
    keeps every name-matched edge otherwise. A partial pass still contributes its
    exact edges: they are additive and correct, and only the destructive half is
    withheld.

    ``on_outcome`` receives the :class:`GraphResolution` for the branch taken —
    on EVERY branch, including the two that return early. It is what makes the
    degradation answerable from the indexed project itself rather than from a
    line buried in a job log, and it is injected for the same reason
    ``on_report`` is: this helper resolves symbols and knows nothing about the
    record the outcome belongs on.

    **That degradation announces itself through ``on_report``, and must.** The
    graph it produces is not visibly broken — it is fully populated, passes
    validation, and renders — so a silent fallback is indistinguishable from a
    healthy index until someone counts cross-file edges by hand. A deployment
    whose image lacked the binaries degraded every index it ever ran, unnoticed,
    for exactly that reason. The callback is INJECTED for the same reason
    ``parse_repo`` takes ``on_progress``: this helper resolves symbols and knows
    nothing about the indexing job the message belongs to.
