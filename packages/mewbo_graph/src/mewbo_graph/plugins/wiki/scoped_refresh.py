"""``ScopedRefreshRunner`` — the two-stage runner behind an incremental refresh.

A scoped refresh re-indexes only what a diff touched: clone the repo at its new
commit, walk it, hand the file list to
:class:`~mewbo_graph.wiki.refresh.RefreshOrchestrator` (change detect → graph
delta → memory reconcile → doc staleness), publish the resulting scope,
regenerate the pages that scope flagged, and finalize. Everything up to the
scope publication is deterministic and zero-LLM apart from the memory
reconciler's drift band, whose call count the scope preview reports verbatim —
which is what makes the Free tier's name an honest word rather than an
approximate one.

It reuses the EXISTING ``IndexingPhase`` vocabulary rather than minting names of
its own: ``clone`` and ``scan`` mean exactly what they always did, the whole
delta pass runs inside ``graph`` (it is a graph re-index, scoped), the act phase
below runs under ``pages``, and ``finalize`` publishes. So the console's phase
map, the progress bar and the resume machinery need no scoped-refresh special
case.

The runner itself owns no session: the API calls :meth:`ScopedRefreshRunner.run`
on a daemon thread, exactly as it drives
:class:`~mewbo_graph.plugins.wiki.graph_only.GraphOnlyIndexer`.

**Two stages, and only the second costs anything.** Stage 1 is everything above
— deterministic and zero-LLM apart from the drift band. Stage 2 (``_act``) hands
the pages the doc planner scored ``edit``/``regenerate`` to a page-regeneration
tier, which the api registers through the ``act_launcher`` seam; with no tier
registered the refresh finalizes with no stage 2 and the timeline says the
flagged pages are still the OLD pages. ``docs.new_pages`` — pages PROPOSED
for undocumented symbols — stays out of both stages: authoring documentation
nobody asked for is a separate, opt-in decision.

        A settled session says the agent STOPPED, never that it did the work.
        Nothing gates the act agent on actually calling ``wiki_submit_page`` —
        QA has ``required_terminal=True`` on ``wiki_emit_answer`` and the page
        writer has no equivalent — so a model that narrates its submissions
        instead of making them ends ``completed``, and every layer above reports
        a refresh that regenerated zero pages as a success. This runner is the
        only place the honest comparison exists, because it is the only thing
        holding both the work-list and the claim set.

        That failure mode is REASONED FROM THE MISSING GATE, not observed in a
        run — recorded so a later reader does not mistake this for the fix to a
        specific incident. What is certain is the asymmetry: nothing else can
        tell the difference, so the cost of being wrong here is one clear error
        on a run that produced nothing anyway.

        The two outcomes are deliberately NOT symmetrical:

        - **Nothing written** is terminal. The tier claimed success and produced
          nothing, so finalizing would publish a lie, and the sidecar staying at
          ``stage="act"`` is what lets a resume retry stage 2 alone.
        - **Some written** is not. Those pages genuinely improved and their doc
          notes are re-stamped, so the work is real and durable — but it has to
          be LOUD and name the pages it did not reach, because a silent partial
          success is how a staleness signal decays into noise.

        The claim set (``get_job_page_ids``) is the same atomic size-of-set
        record ``get_job_submitted_count`` counts, so this survives a resume for
        the same reason that counter does — and unlike the bare count it can
        name WHICH pages are still owed. It is intersected with the work-list
        rather than trusted wholesale: a page written that nobody asked for is

    The PREDICTION side of the fingerprint comparison, and its asymmetry with

    ``build_graph_core`` records what a run ACTUALLY did — ``embedding_model``
    stays ``None`` there unless a vector was really persisted, because a
    fingerprint of a finished index must not claim a capability the artifacts
    do not have. Here nothing has run yet, so the honest answer is what the
    current configuration WOULD use. The same field therefore means "what
    happened" on the stored side and "what would happen" on this one, and
    comparing them is exactly the question a refresh needs answered.

    ``embedding_model`` is ``None`` when embedding is switched off, which is
    what makes the comparison catch the case worth catching: an index built
    WITH vectors read against a deployment that would now build none is
    genuinely stale, and collapsing that to a match would leave half the store
    unsearchable with nothing to show for it. It resolves the model NAME from
    config only — no embedding call, no network, no proxy round-trip — because
    this runs on the HTTP request path where a refresh is being decided.

    ``O(1)``: config reads, one installed-package metadata lookup, and a
    ``shutil.which`` per resolver binary. Reuses ``build_graph``'s probes
    rather than re-deriving them, so the two sides of every comparison are
