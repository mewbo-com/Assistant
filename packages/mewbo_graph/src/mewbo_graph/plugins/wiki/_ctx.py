    Tiers 2-5 all yield a slug-only ctx (``answer_id=None``) so the
    read/navigate tools ground while the QA-emit/event tools keep guarding on
    ``answer_id`` — each is deliberately shape-identical to the others, so every
    tool already safe under one is safe under the rest. ``None`` means only
    that the session's project has no wiki indexed (or it has no project at all),
    which is an EXPECTED state rather than a fault — see
    ``WikiSessionTool._ungrounded_result``.

    **Tier 2 is what lets ONE session both READ and WRITE pages.** The page
    read tools resolve through here while ``wiki_submit_page`` resolves through
    :func:`resolve_job_ctx`, and without this tier no single session can satisfy
    both: a job-bound session has no QA answer and no workspace, so every read
    refuses, while a QA/structured session has no job, so every write
    refuses. An agent that must DECIDE which pages need updating has to read them
    first, so the two halves had to meet somewhere; they meet here, on the slug,
    which is the only thing the read tools need and which a job already knows.
    It sits directly below the QA tier because both are exact registrations,
    above the two heuristic tiers below it — and a session cannot be both a
    registered answer and an indexing job, so the ordering is unambiguous rather
    than a tie-break.

    The event stream drives the live indexing-page progress bar; the
    persisted snapshot drives the landing-page card (which polls the
    snapshot endpoint, never SSE). Both reads are derived from the same
    write here, so the two surfaces can never disagree.

    A BACKWARD move is dropped from both. A resume is instructed to re-clone and
    re-scan so the source is on disk before pages are written, so those tools
    re-stamp phases the job passed long ago — a job that had already built its
    graph reported ``scan`` again with a later ``phase_started_at``, walking the
    progress bar backwards. Dropping the write on both surfaces rather than one
    is what preserves the can-never-disagree property above; the phase's own
    ``log`` lines still show the re-run happening. A deliberate RESTART is
    exempt: it really is redoing the pipeline from the top, so its phase must be
    allowed to return there.

    Entering a phase CLEARS the three ``phase_progress_*`` fields and stamps
    ``last_progress_at``. The clear is the invariant every progress reader leans
    on: a non-null ``phase_progress_current`` therefore always belongs to the
    phase named in ``phase``, never a leftover from one that already ended —
    which is precisely how ``scanned_count``/``current_file`` became
    untrustworthy. It lives HERE rather than at each phase tool so a phase added
    later inherits it without knowing it exists.

    ``last_progress_at`` is STAMPED, not cleared, and that asymmetry is
    deliberate: it answers "when did this job last move at all", and entering a
    phase is movement. Clearing it would erase the one signal that separates a
    long phase from a dead one at the exact moment a phase begins.

    A ctx with no job at all (a maintainer session — see
    :attr:`WikiJobCtx.job_bound`) reports nothing: a phase is a position in an
