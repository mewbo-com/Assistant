"""``GraphOnlyIndexer`` — deterministic, zero-LLM repository indexing.

Developer mode unlocks a DETERMINISTIC index path: ``clone → scan → graph →
finalize``, SKIPPING the LLM-driven phases (``enrich``/``plan``/``pages``). The
result is a project with a fully populated AST code graph (still visualisable via
``GET /v1/wiki/projects/<slug>/graph``) but ZERO documentation pages; the project
record is stamped ``graph_only=True`` so the doc-content read seam raises
:class:`~mewbo_graph.wiki.errors.DocumentationUnavailableError`.

This is an atomic class: it holds the per-run state (job ctx + submission) and
its behaviour is methods over that state. It REUSES the existing phase tools'
cores — the ``clone``/``scan`` head it inherits from
:class:`~mewbo_graph.plugins.wiki._jobless.JoblessIndexRunner`, the tree-sitter
parse+persist+embed core (:func:`build_graph.build_graph_core`), and the
finalize helpers — so there is no duplicated git/scan/tree-sitter logic. It
emits the SAME ``phase``/``log``/``queued``/``complete`` events the agent path
does, so the job-status SSE stream + console progress keep working unchanged.

It runs with NO Mewbo session and NO LLM agent: the API calls
:meth:`GraphOnlyIndexer.run` on a background thread (mirroring ``start_async``),
not by spawning a ``wiki-indexer`` playbook.
