    The third adapter over :func:`run_git_with_chain`, and it differs from

    an ephemeral index clone:

    - **Full history, every branch** (``depth=None``). ``--depth`` implies
      ``--single-branch``, so a shallow clone cannot diff against the default
      branch or cut a branch from it — the first two things a task does.
    - **The origin URL is scrubbed afterwards.** The executor authenticates by
      injecting the credential into the URL, and ``git clone <authed-url>``
      persists exactly that string as ``remote.origin.url``. An ephemeral clone
      is deleted with the token still in it; this one is handed to an agent that
      will read ``.git/config`` and run ``git remote -v``, so the token would ride
      into a transcript. Resetting origin to the clean *url* is therefore part of
      the operation, not a caller's responsibility — a scrub a caller can forget
      is a scrub that will be forgotten. Pushes re-resolve through the chain,
      exactly as every other authenticated git call here does.

    *timeout* is per credential-chain attempt and is the CALLER's, because this
    runs under an HTTP request rather than a background index job: the caller
    owns the budget its client is waiting on.

    No ref is pinned. A registered repository's ``default_branch`` is recorded
    as-is and never verified, so pinning it would turn a stale value into a hard
    clone failure; the remote's own HEAD is the truth and costs nothing.
