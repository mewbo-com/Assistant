"""Mewbo Graph — the optional knowledge-graph substrate.

A single shared engine powering both **MewboWiki** (code wiki indexing/Q&A)
and **Mewbo Search** (the Source Capability Graph): tree-sitter code graph,
the multiplex atomic-note memory engine, the embedder, the hybrid retriever,
and the SCG reachability router. It sits one layer above ``mewbo-core`` and
imports strictly **down** — never an app, never ``mewbo-tools``.

Optional and dependency-ignorable: heavy deps live behind the ``treesitter``
and ``retrieval`` extras, and every import site is guarded so the feature is
simply absent (never a crash) when the extra is uninstalled.

Importing this package registers its bundled plugin suites (``wiki`` and
``scg``) with the core plugin loader, so a host that depends on
``mewbo-graph`` (e.g. ``mewbo-api[wiki]``) gets them discovered automatically
— see :func:`register_builtin_plugins`.
