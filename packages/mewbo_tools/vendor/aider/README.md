# Aider Vendor Snapshot

This directory vendors a minimal subset of Aider (https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)
needed for the Mewbo edit-block adapter. It is intentionally small and updated
via scripts/vendor_aider.sh.

These files are a verbatim upstream reference snapshot and are never imported
at runtime. The adapted, importable copies live under
packages/mewbo_tools/src/mewbo_tools/ (aider_bridge/ and vendor/aider/).

Pinned upstream commit: 4bf56b77145b0be593ed48c3c90cdecead217496

Included files:
- aider/coders/editblock_coder.py
- aider/coders/editblock_prompts.py
- aider/coders/editblock_fenced_prompts.py
