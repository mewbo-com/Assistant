"""Long-lived shell sessions: background start, incremental read, stdin, kill.

The one process primitive behind BOTH shell surfaces. A foreground call is not a
different mechanism from a background one — it is the same session waited on
until it exits, which is why there is a single :class:`ShellSession` here and no
parallel one-shot path. (Codex's ``unified_exec`` reaches the same conclusion
from the other direction: one ``exec_command`` returns final output when the
process finishes inside its yield window and a session handle when it does not.)

Four verbs ship together — start, read, write, kill — deliberately. opencode
REMOVED model-facing background execution rather than expose a start with no
observation or cancellation ("process-local status is not a sufficient remote
contract"), and that is the right bar: a background start whose output nobody
can read and whose process nobody can stop is a leak wearing a feature's name.

        active, and a model-chosen root would be a model-chosen sandbox. This is

        makes the scope impossible to forget at a future call site.
