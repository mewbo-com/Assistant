    Two views of the path are checked so legitimate symlinks inside a
    project root are honored:

    * ``resolved`` — ``Path.resolve()``; normalizes ``..`` *and* follows
      symlinks. Authoritative physical location on disk.
    * ``logical``  — ``os.path.abspath``; normalizes ``..`` but preserves
      symlinks. Reflects the user's intent when a symlink lives inside
      an allowed root (e.g. ``<project>/homelab`` → ``/mnt/external``).

    The path is accepted if *either* view lands under an allowed root.
    ``../`` escape attempts still fail both checks and are rejected.

    **Workspace containment.** When an ACTIVE
    :class:`~mewbo_core.workspace.WorkspaceContainment` applies — passed
    explicitly, or (fallback) the one the loop set for the current execution
    context via :func:`~mewbo_core.workspace.get_active_containment` — the broad
    tenant union above is COLLAPSED to the containment's own allowed roots
    (workspace root + Mewbo scratch), and a ``write=True`` call is additionally
    checked against the tier's write rule (``read_only`` permits none). Denials
    still name what IS allowed. ``containment=None`` with no active context
    containment ⇒ byte-identical historical behaviour; enforcement is separately
    staged behind ``agent.workspace_enforcement`` at the loop, so nothing here
    activates until that flag flips.
