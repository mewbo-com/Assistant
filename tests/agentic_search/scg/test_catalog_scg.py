"""SCG-resolution tests for :class:`SourceCatalog`.

``catalog.py`` resolves a selected source's ``allowed_tools`` from the live SCG
capability nodes for that source, intersected with ``filter_specs()`` registry
availability. Before a source is mapped it falls back to the illustrative
``tools`` declared in ``fixtures.SOURCE_CATALOG`` — but only while demo seeding
is enabled. These tests pin every branch:

* **SCG present** — capability nodes for a source drive ``tools_for`` /
  ``entries`` (∩ ``filter_specs``), overriding the demo fallback.
* **SCG absent + seeding on** — resolution falls back to the fixtures demo tools
  (still ∩ availability for ``tools_for``), without error.
* **SCG absent + seeding off** — a production install drops the demo fixtures
  from the catalog and resolves no tools, never a hardcoded guess (live
  configured MCP servers are covered in ``test_catalog_live_sources.py``).
* **Unconfigured demo source (seeding on)** — still returned, never omitted.

The store is the real JSON backend under a tmp dir (no MongoDB). ``filter_specs``
runs against the real built-in registry, so the intersection is asserted against
the *live* available ids rather than hard-coded names — ``read_file`` is a
guaranteed built-in we anchor on.
