"""Tests for ``resolve_safe_path`` symlink handling.

A symlink living inside an allowed project root must be honored even when
its target sits outside every root. The previous implementation called
``Path.resolve()`` which follows symlinks, so a workspace symlink like
``<project>/homelab -> /mnt/external`` was rejected with
"resolves outside all allowed project roots". ``../`` escape attempts
must still be rejected.
