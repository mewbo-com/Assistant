clone via ``subprocess.run`` populating the clone dir, and the embedder switched

    The sibling of the supersede regression above, and a strictly harder
    property: that test proves the untouched rows still EXIST, this one proves a
    reader can still SEE them. Both can fail independently and the second failed
    silently for a while.

    ``store.live_scope(slug)`` is ``CommitScope.at(project.commit_sha)``, and it
    is what the knowledge-graph view, the retriever and the agent graph tools
    all read through. A scoped refresh re-stamps only what it re-parsed, so if
    it advances the project row without carrying the rest forward, every one of
    those readers resolves a generation containing just the handful of changed
    files. Nothing errors. Nothing is deleted. The codebase simply stops being
    there, which is why this needs its own assertion rather than trusting the
    existence check.
