"""Every declared ``wiki.refresh`` field must have a live consumer.

A tripwire, not a unit test. The seven thresholds under this key were declared,
documented and shipped while nothing read them, and the reason that survived
review is structural: each stage's constructor default equals its config
default, so an unwired knob produces byte-identical behaviour to a wired one.
Nothing fails. Nothing looks wrong. The operator's setting is simply ignored.

So this file enumerates ``WikiRefreshConfig.model_fields`` rather than listing
names. A hand-written list of seven would pass forever after an eighth field is
added and forgotten — which is precisely the defect being guarded against, one
field later.

The check runs at RUNTIME, against the real composition root. A static or
grep-based version was tried and is worse than useless here: the reader passes
each field NAME as a variable, so a search for the literal string reports every
one of them as unwired. The only honest question is whether a non-default value
set in config arrives on the object that consumes it.
