"""A span tree spanning concurrent sub-agents must be walkable root→child.

The defect these cover: every span opened by the engine passed the session's
``trace_context`` — a ``trace_id`` and nothing else — so the SDK minted a random
parent span id, wrapped it in a non-recording span nobody exports, and parented
the observation to it. Every span was therefore an orphan by construction, at
every depth, and per-agent token attribution from a trace alone was impossible:
a child's spans could not be told from a sibling's because neither reached the
root.

Concurrency is load-bearing here, not decoration. A single child would fail on
the orphaning alone, but only concurrent children can catch the other half — a
handoff that keeps the parent id anywhere task-shared cross-links one child's
spans under its sibling, and the tree stays wrong while every span resolves.
