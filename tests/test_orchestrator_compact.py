"""Tests for the user-initiated ``/compact`` path.

When a user types ``/compact`` the orchestrator must not propagate
exceptions — compaction failing (e.g. because an MCP reconnection
raised during summary generation) should surface as a user-facing
response message and a ``compact_failed`` completion reason, never
as a crashed CLI turn.
