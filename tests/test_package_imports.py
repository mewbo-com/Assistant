"""Every distributed package imports — asserted in a fresh interpreter per package.

This is NOT a feature test. It pins one property the suite structurally cannot
prove about itself: that each shipped package can be imported at all.

**A green suite is evidence about the tests, not about the packages.** The suite
covers what the suite imports, and coverage of the module surface is uneven —
`mewbo_mcp` has very little. A package once reached the main branch holding a
module that named a moved import at its old path: the package raised
`ModuleNotFoundError` on import, and the suite stayed green, because no test
imported that module. It was found by a person reading code, not by a gate.

**A subprocess per package is the point, not an implementation detail.** An
in-process loop shares ``sys.modules``, so whichever package imported first
satisfies the imports of every package checked after it, and the ordering
problems the check exists to find are exactly the ones it would hide. Such a
check passes and proves nothing. :meth:`FreshInterpreterProbe.run` therefore
spends a whole interpreter per package, and
``test_each_package_was_probed_in_a_genuinely_fresh_interpreter`` asserts the
isolation actually held rather than assuming it.

**Package roots are not enough.** Four of the seven root ``__init__.py`` files
are docstring-only by deliberate design — a subpackage that re-exports its
modules makes importing one of them execute all of them, which changes what
module-level side effects fire and in what order. So ``import mewbo_core``
exercises almost nothing. Every module is imported individually instead.

The complementary defect class — a packaged asset resolved relative to a
module's own position, which breaks when that module moves and fails at render
time rather than import time — is invisible here by construction, because this
gate is about imports and that is a filesystem path. It has its own gate in
``test_packaged_resource_anchors.py``.
