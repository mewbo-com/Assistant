"""``allowed_tools`` is THREE states, and collapsing two of them fails open.

* ``None`` — unrestricted: impose no allowlist at all.
* ``[]`` — explicitly none: this principal is granted NO tools.
* a non-empty list — exactly those.

The dangerous collapse is ``[]`` → ``None``: a scope that deliberately granted
zero tools silently becoming every tool. It is the same shape as the credential
limb in :mod:`tests.iam.test_key_scope_three_state`, one layer down, and it
recurred independently at seven sites because every one of them tested the field
with truthiness.

These drive the law at each layer that owns a copy of the decision — the
registry filter, the loop's spawn gate, the session-tool gates, both parse
seams, and the delegation path where the argument is MODEL-SUPPLIED — rather
than asserting it once centrally, because a collapse reintroduced at any single
site is exactly as fail-open as the original.
