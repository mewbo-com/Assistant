"""The committed config artifacts match the model they are generated from.

``configs/app.schema.json`` and ``docs/configuration.md`` are both COMMITTED and
both GENERATED — the schema from ``AppConfig`` by
``scripts/ci/generate_config_schema.py``, the reference page from the schema by
``docs/hooks/schema_to_md.py``. Adding a field to ``config.py`` and not
regenerating leaves them describing a model that no longer exists, and the
symptom is silent: the console's Settings pane reads the schema, so a knob that
never reached it simply is not there, with nothing raised and nothing logged.

**This test is what checks it.** CI does run — the coverage workflow invokes a
bare ``pytest``, which honours ``testpaths`` and so collects this file — but the
workflow only re-runs the check; it does not perform one. A generated artifact
with no test behind it therefore has nothing checking it, no matter how much CI
is configured. The gating workflows are also ``pull_request``-only, so a plain
push to a branch runs nothing at all: open the PR to get the signal.

Neither test invokes a writing path. The schema half imports the generator's
pure builder and compares its return value; the docs half only READS the two
committed files. A test that regenerated first would have written to the repo as
a side effect and could "pass" by overwriting the very drift it exists to
report.
