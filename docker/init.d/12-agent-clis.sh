#!/bin/sh
# 12-agent-clis.sh — Provision the forge CLIs into the runtime toolbox.
#
# gh  (GitHub CLI) — github.com only; git auth bridges through it in
#     10-git-setup.sh when GITHUB_TOKEN is set.
# tea (Gitea CLI)  — every other forge; logins are derived in 15-tea-setup.sh,
#     which is why this runs BEFORE it (12 < 15). Installing and authenticating
#     in one script is what let the same download get duplicated into
#     Dockerfile.api; keeping the two concerns in two scripts keeps one
#     installer.
#
# Both ship static release binaries, so neither needs apt, a keyring, an apt
# source list, or root — which is the whole reason they can live at runtime.
# Versions are overridable from .env for a pin or a rollback.
